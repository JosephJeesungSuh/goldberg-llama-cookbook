        "text": "Hey! Nice to meet you. Here's a bit about myself. I am a bit reserved when meeting new people, but once I get to you you, we'll be good friends. According to other people, I am driven, hardworking, creative, artistic, caring, compassionate, and stubborn. I would add that I am ambitious and can sometimes come across as snobbish or cold, when in reality I am just a bit shy. Some interests of mine: I love music; it is a great passion of mine. I play violin, piano, saxophone, and I'm learning bass, and if I had my way, I'd learn every instrument I could get my hands on. I also am greatly interested in art. I love drawing, painting, animation, sculpting...anything that involves creating really. I am currently an intended Computer Science major, but depending on how things go in the coming semester, I might switch to Data Science, Operations Research, Applied Math, or something else entirely. I would also love to travel. Although I haven't been able to travel much, I plan to travel to Europe and explore every country there. In regard to myself as a roommate, I am generally easy-going. Although I would say that I sometimes don't talk to people sometimes, it's not because I'm mad at you, or don't like you or anything like that, I'm just quiet and reserved sometimes. I also love to read, play games (boardgames, sports, cards, puzzles) with my family and friends, and watch movies. ",

Some friends of mine who live away from me, I don't text or call them; I never follow up with them, and this leads to many friendships being lost. I also tend to isolate myself from people sometimes and this also has the same effect. There's not much I feel comfortable sharing on this page, but I've tried my best. "

I'm a kind, loving, very empathetic person. I care a lot about the state of our world, other people and their quality of life, and especially my family and friends. I'm extremely uncomfortable with making others uncomfortable and I'm quite independent so I would rather do my own thing than impose my will over anyone and make them do something they don't want to. I'm not jealous, power or money hungry, and I'm quite content and grateful in my everyday life. I have social anxiety and also deal with regular anxiety/feeling down from time to time. This is mostly because of how much I care for others in my life and how much their pain and struggles affect me. I'm on the quiet and shy side. It takes a while for me to feel truly comfortable with a new person. I love myself very much and consider myself my first best friend. While, due to my social anxiety, I doubt other like my personality I personally love it. I think highly of myself and always try to be true to myself. ",

I also don't like losing, which is a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. Good because it allows me to have a competitive nature. Bad because this competitive nature can sometimes get out of hand. I can also be a bit selfish when wanting to do a specific activity, like going out to eat somewhere for example. In this case I would pick out the place with no regard for other's opinion."

Therefore, I tend to be perceived as very quiet and a little taciturn when I am around people who I am not comfortable with. However, once I begin to feel comfortable around someone, I become a chatterbox, hyper, and affectionate. I believe that there are three types of people: people who like to take life not too seriously and just have fun and enjoy, people who take life seriously and deeply and pour meaning into nearly everything, and people who are a mix of both. I would say that I lean more towards the second option. I believe that I am a very introspective and sensitive person, both emotionally and sensorily. Because of such inclinations, I do not take life lightly at all and I tend to perceive life in a deeper sense than others. I am not too outgoing, and I consider myself very introverted. I do not go outdoors too often, but when I do, I would prefer to go alone or with someone who I am deeply close with. I have a very small social group because I very much prioritize quality time, and for me, really high quality time comes only from people that are very precious to me, such as my family, or a very close friend. And because I pour my all into spending this time with such people, I do not have nor wish to expend the energy on times with others who I am not that close to. I am also very emotionally fluctuating. ",

But to fully dive into my negative personality traits, as mentioned earlier, my mood tends to fluctuate a lot depending on my emotion. On top of that, I get very easily stimulated by any external cause, like maybe a certain sound I didn't like, or the very subtle tone of my roommate that irked me. Very trivial things can cause me to get very emotional, more specifically, angry, and I think I can sometimes be more emotionally prone, so my facial expressions deliver my mood right away. I am not very good at hiding how I feel even though I try. I also consider myself a fairly pessimistic person. I end up resorting to negative thoughts in situations instead of thinking of the good. "

I like to see a clear distinction in spaces so I know what's mine to keep in order. I set weekly days where certain household chores must be done. I try to go to bed before 12pm and wake up by 8am; however, these our loose boundaries. While I have high standards/regulations for myself, I am extremely easy going and flexible with others. I tend to go with the flow and match the energy of others in the room. I'm empathetic, talkative, and highly energetic at times. I do need my \"alone\" decompression time where I turn my brain off and don't talk to anyone for a bit. I love animals, being active (but HATE working out), and coffee. I am anxious about doing new things and want everyone to like me. I love reading but with school have not had time or the mental energy to read more than two non-textbooks a year... I'm trying to learn Spanish. I love watching TV. I spend too much time on Tik Tok... I'm the oldest child with two younger siblings - a brother and sister. I grew up with a big extended family. I was born and raised in Minnesota. I love traveling and wish to do more. I have always had some sort of job since I was 9 (legally, 16). I am 50/50 night owl and morning person, it switches from time to time. I care about others and the planet. I am a democrat... I panic when I see clocks counting down. I hate parallel parking. I am extremely sarcastic and love to make jokes.",

When I am extremely busy, this tends to happen. I leave clothes, books, and too many cups in my room / on the floor. Dishes can pile up from time to time because I hate doing dishes after cooking. I tend to be grumpy in the morning. I don't like sharing but will offer. If I am annoyed with people, I usually don't tell them until it boils over. I love talking on the phone but hate talking in front of other people. I am a nosy person. I am instinctively judgmental and hold everyone at a distance until I'm sure of who they really are.

I am extremely conservative of energy and like to keep costs low. I do well living with others who are as considerate of me as I am of them. Similarly, my ideal roommate is someone who is also quiet and actively against disruption. I haven't had much conflict if I screen very well initially. With that said, if there was an issue, I would be very patient and likely not address it, even if it got out of hand. This is why screening is so important to me.\nIn a perfect universe, aside from the basics, my roommate would like to watch movies together and, if they cycle, that would be ideal to cycle together! I also would love someone who is as supportive as me, especially when it comes to academic pursuits. However, given my long history of having roommates, being close friends with my roommate is not a necessity. I've grown more open to it over time.\nLike many people who are similar to me, my comfortability and openness grows over time and with consistency of a relationship. I like to set expectations/rules high, so that we don't have to retroactively address this later. I'm not as uptight as this description makes me seem.",

I try to be considerate of others however I am not very confrontational so I will usually avoid anything that is bothering me, but when I do sit down for conversations I tend to be more like a mediator -- I am usually in the middle of a lot of opinion sides and can be very indecisive. I try to be helpful and social when deemed necessary, but I really like set hangouts and quick conversation because I can only be bubbly for so long.

Sometimes my anger overwhelms me to the point that I find it difficult to manage, and I may become silent, unable to communicate my feelings. It can be annoying for me and those around me since it makes it hard to communicate.\n\nI'm making a conscious effort to control these emotions better. I've discovered that practicing mindfulness and other relaxation techniques, as well as having some alone time, are beneficial. Whenever I appear agitated or abruptly withdraw, it's typically because I need some time to collect myself. Nothing about it is personal.\n\nI value open communication, so please let me know if my actions ever have an impact on you. I'm dedicated to fostering harmony in our home, and I hope that we can help one another overcome any obstacles that may arise."

I tend to sleep late around 2 or 3 am and wake up around 9 am. I can be pretty quiet and keep to myself. I really like listening to music and play a little bit of guitar for fun. I really enjoy practicing to get better at the various activities I do and pride myself in being good at these things. I dislike when people are better than me at these things, but also appreciate the challenge and motivation I get from pushing myself to be better than them. I tend to be very blunt and straightforward and would rather have an argument than hold a grudge. I am fairly neat and like to have a routine especially when studying.",

I try to always be efficient, think about things from every angle, and get praise for the work that I have done. I feed off of external validation and love to impress people. I also love to make people feel loved, cared about, and heard. I enjoy trying new things and experiencing new experiences as much as I can. Meeting new pele who have lived a different life than me is extremely interesting becuase everyone has their own story and their own way that they got to this place. I love being there for my friends and am the type of person that would drop anything for them. I trust people a lot and am very open about my life. I can sometimes be a bit naive in terms of what people\u2019s motivations are. I like to see the best in people and help them in any way that I can. I love to go out, but am also always down for a night in. I love to play sports and be creative, none of whihc I am innately good at, but certainly enjoy nonetheless. I am working on accepting myself for who I am and being confident in my own skin. I can tend to get jealous by those around me due to my own insecurities, but that is Something that I am actively aware of and am working on fixing. I try to be as transparent as possible about my feelings and emotions and am a strong believer in that honesty is the best policy, I love to surround myself by happy, positive people who uplift and inspire me.

I rarely bring guests home since I do most of my very busy socializing at clubs and alt music events. I don't like to invite people to my personal space since it feels inappropriate unless I trust them deeply, so guests shouldn't be an issue. I also don't like cooking and keep most of my chore necessities at the simplest, most basic level.

I can't hold back my distrustful nature and need for a personal space, since I literally would be setting the roomate up for a very discomforting surprise if they find themselves rejected or treated \"rudely\" by me. I don't like hurting people, as a very emotionally sensitive person myself, something I also didn't share. I did highlight my distrusting, brooding personality's tendency to not cause much noise whether by music or bringing strangers, since a lot of people feel safer with that. Though, I like to hang out w louder extroverts who would do all of that so as to get me out of my shell, as long as we live within separate walls since I MUST have a personal space. I also didn't share that when I have mental breakdowns I'm very shaky, needy, and will grunt out loud. I have some mental health issues and know no limits with how dark my creativity can get, though i am very excited and enthusiastic about it all. If i am lucky to find a roomate that shares this interest we woulc be eccentric dark weirdos together, but I don't share that overtly to find housing easily, or else, finances can be even more of an issue than they already are in my life.

My favorite hobby would have to be playing video games, listening to music, and watching YouTube or shows. I believe in treating others fairly unless they prove unworthy of such treatment. I am a creature of habit, but can still remain flexible when it comes to shared spaces. While I prefer not to sugarcoat things that should be said when it comes to friends that I am close to, I tend to be more reserved when it comes to less familiar faces as to not offend. I'm more headstrong and can be stubborn at times. In general, I would say that I like to keep to myself more until I am familiar with the environment surrounding me. Depending on the situation or people involved, I don't particularly like to share my belongings. I am loyal to my friends and care about the wellbeing of those who I am closest to. I'm not always punctual. I'm not necessarily argumentative or aggressive, but can be when I need to be, to stand up for what I believe in. ",

This is because I think that sometimes it's not worth expressing every negative emotion you have, obviously if it helps to talk through it and benefits both parties, it's worthy of bringing up. But otherwise, sometimes it's better not to express them directly. I can definitely be selfish and look towards doing things that self benefit me the most. I will lie to get out of being at a place I don't want to be even if the hosts have good intentions. If I appreciate you I'm much more likely to express it through action rather than words, which sometimes can make one feel underappreciated. Sometimes I will just get annoyed for reasons which evade me and I'm not the kindest person in that moment.

        "text": "I am kind of neurotic but I try not to take myself too seriously. I try to stay organized and keep my space clean because it helps me feel less stressed, but I find it kind of hard. My perception of time is not great, so I am perpetually late to things. I am somewhat conflict-avoidant, especially with people I don't know well, so I will often compromise where I can. However, I feel most secure when I have space to myself. I am determined and a hard worker, although I can get overwhelmed easily when I have too much on my to-do list. I like to make people laugh and often try and use humor as a way to connect with people. I try to be a good friend and good listener. I am creative and can be quite goofy when I'm comfortable. I like to write, especially poetry, and I love listening to music and singing. I'm introspective; I like to take walks and talk to myself. I am kind of a mom friend: I'm really bad at making decisions for myself or standing up for myself, but if my friend needs me to talk to a waiter or help them decide on which movie to see, I can totally do it. I am an ambivert - I can get worn out spending too much time with people, but I also thrive in communities where I feel truly welcomed and accepted. I am flexible when it comes to spending time with others, because I most often enjoy watching my friends enjoy themselves. ",

        "negative_text": "I love to debate people whom I know well, sometimes just for entertainment when I'm bored, and sometimes that can turn more aggressive than I intend and can turn into an argument. I'm very self-critical, which can sometimes turn outward to criticism of others, though I try to mitigate it. My issues with executive functioning and time management can make me a bad friend because I tend to flake on plans so I can finish work. I can get overwhelmed with texting people back, so sometimes I'll just ghost my friends for weeks or even months because the thought of writing a text back to them is too overwhelming. I take a long time to connect with most people and open up to them, so most of my closest friends are people from my high school, which makes me feel very behind all of my peers, who all have close college friends. I'm a chronic procrastinator and even though I always promise myself I'll do better, I often can't because I need a structure to operate in and can't just make changes to my own behavior without accountability. In being conflict avoidant, I can sometimes bottle up resentment or become passive aggressive. I'm trying to fix that though. I can be selfish and incredibly self-centered, especially when I really really want something. I'm kind of addicted to the internet, like to content online like instagram videos or YouTube."

        "text": "To describe my personality using single words I believe would be an injustice. To begin, I believe anything is possible. I grew up incredibly poor, moved around a lot, and never actually had time to settle down anywhere till I arrived at high school. I saw my mom go from working 16-hour days to creating and maintaining her own successful business. I believe if you want something bad enough, and you surround yourself with people who share similar goals, you will inevitably achieve anything and everything you want. I also listen to a lot of Drake. I know, you might be wondering, what the hell does this have anything to do with this? It has a lot to do with it. I believe his music of success and possibility motivates me to achieve more every day. This man pumps album after album. single after single, and interviews after interviews, and then wakes up to do it all over again. The mindset of constantly being productive and preserving no matter the mood or situation you are in, really demonstrates how one really does have limitless potential as long as one moves and and speaks with purpose. A person with no purpose is a person with no goals or ambitions. This is not to say I don't enjoy spending time with friends and goofing off every now and then but I will never let it consume me or alter my path to success. I believe the biggest obstacle that trumps 99.99% of people off the road to success is vulnerability. Undoubtedly, being vulnerable is very hard. That I would say is a trait I have. Being vulnerable is a difficult thing. I don't know why, maybe it's all the moving or the failed friendships, but putting myself out there and really just letting myself be analyzed with no barriers or smokescreens to cover up any things I might be lacking in is my worst quality. But I believe, it's one of my strongest. Becoming too attached to something or someone will without a doubt, change your life. That is why I believe I must always keep a close but safe distance from the people I love (except my mother) because you never want to be locked down with a sinking ship (unless it's my mom, I love my mom). Anyway, I know this is pretty random, and well not to script at all but in actuality, I think it is. Using words to describe yourself is overrated, let me spiel on about random thoughts that go off in my mind and let you decide what words to use. ",

        "negative_text": "Back to this again hu? What a world we live in. To think, I sign up for a class just to answer some survey's that otherwise would cost the psychology department a lot of resources to send out to random people, but here I am, doing it for free. The beauty of grades. What an interesting thing. If I do not complete this survey, I would be at risk for loosing points, in a sense, I am being blackmailed, forced to complete this. But why? I don't know, and I don't really care, but it was a thought rummaging back and fourth through the wrinkles in my brain.\n\nWhat would I say is my worst quality?\n\n...\n\nI don't even know who this is yet somehow, I'm here being completely open with you. I hope to whoever reads this, you not only have a beautiful day, but also one that is fulfilling and aligns with your goals. A successful day sounds more appropriate.\n\nAlright, alright, enough silly dallying around.\n\nMy biggest problem, the worst traits I see in myself, is........... \n\nthe anticipation is real.....\n\n....\n\nI never feel content with what I have. There is not a moment that goes by where I am truly happy with everything I have. I don't attribute this to my mother, or absent father, but society. We live in a society that is hyper successful, we have more millionaire's than ever before. You hop on social media and what do you see? Someone living a better, more fulfilling life. Sure I can take a break from social media and sure I shouldn't trust social media because that's not actually reality, that's merely the 1% of the 1% showing up on your feed. But I ask, that isn't reality, then why does it exist? Just something to think about. This applies to everything in my life. Work, fitness, academia, and most importantly, relationships.\n\nI am afraid of commitment. I love my mother, and she's everything I can every ask for. What does this this have to do with commitment? Because that is the only life long commitment In which I truly feel content with. I really do believe I have the best mother in the history of mothers. However, when it comes with other people, I never have this feeling, and it scares me. I recently got out of a 5 year relationship. A lot of people around me at the time would say it was incredibly abusive, at some point I do agree with them. It was a terrible relationship, and sure we probably didn't love each other and most likely stuck it out because it was familiar to us, and in a sense, we were committed to each other, a five year contract, signed in blood and tears. In the moment, it felt like a lifetime but when it was over, felt as if it had never happened. Drunk off arguments and petty conversations that only separated us further in the hole we dug ourselves. Now that I am out, picking up a shovel and digging a new hole with someone seems the like scariest thing in this world. I have had countless opportunities to be in relationships with some woman that men would absolutely die for (and yes, I am proud about that) but then suddenly out of nowhere, I can't do it anymore. The idea of even settling down with someone ever again, scares the living crap out of me. Why? Might of been the moving around a lot when I was a kid, or maybe the idea that I could possibly find someone better. Or maybe something much deeper than all of that\n\nInsecurities. I do not feel like that guy. Yet. I don't believe I can truly and honestly say that I can give someone all of me when I have little to nothing to give. I have this belief that women, have this intrinsic beauty to them, that men could never have. Woman are just so mesmerizing and captivating that even if a woman has nothing to her name, she can easily seduce a prince and a king to do her bidding. Of course, this isn't medieval times but the concept still applies. Woman have so much power right from birth that men will just never have. So, right now, where it stands, I don't see myself as someone who has achieved and received enough accolades to pursue and settle down with such a beautiful person. And I don't mean physical beauty, although it does matter to an extent, I mean emotional, inner beauty. Someone who can understand me as much as i wish to understand them. \n\nI am sure there's more but in all honestly I feel as If I have written enough and if I am being completely honest and transparent, which I is something I believe you value, right? This drop dead gorgeous girl that could only be describe using dreams and fairytales decided to sit right in front of me at the library. What a life am I right? In fact, what lives? I just seen her but I already got a whole life planned with her present. Or maybe its another one of my negative traits, I tend to fantasize, but hey that's just a theory. A trait theory."

        "text": "Hi future roomie! My name is Christina Nguyen and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm super excited to get to know you this year and want to introduce a bit of myself to you. People who have just met me typically describe me as someone who is quite introverted and one who keeps to myself. Similarly, at the beginning of the school year, I will probably be a bit more closed off and act shy or reserved. I find it a bit hard to trust people because of friends who have hurt me in the past, but once I warm up to you, I am super energetic and extroverted! Friends who know me quite well describe me as someone who is really enthusiastic, goofy, and outgoing. For myself, I would say that I am more extroverted around introverted people and more introverted around extroverted people. Moreover, when it comes to my close friends, once I start to trust you, I open myself up a lot and am quite loyal. I want to know you, and your interests, and want to do my best to support you! I am quite empathetic in that sense, and try to put others before myself. However, sometimes this puts a toll on my mental health because I don't prioritize myself at times. I try to be respectful and kind to those around me, but if someone treats my loved ones with disrespect, I will stand up for them, even though it can scare me sometimes. With roomies, I really prioritize communication and am quite open-minded and honest. I will confront you if I feel uncomfortable about something and will talk with you to sort things out. However, sometimes I try to suppress my feelings with the anxiety and fear that people won't like me if I speak my mind. I have been trying to work on that though because I know my self-worth is important. In terms of my favorite activities, I like to do calligraphy, try new foods, and hang out with my friends and family. Given this short description of my personality, I hope this gives you a bit of insight into who I am! :)",

I tend to overthink a lot when I talk to someone, and sometimes those thoughts eat me up in the sense that I might have said something wrong to hurt someone's feelings or cause them to not like mem anymore. Even though I try hard to not overthink about what others think of me, sometimes, I get a bit anxious if someone's texting tone or talking tone changes. Moreover, it takes me awhile to trust people, so I might come off as a bit closed off at first. I have been trying to open myself up more, but I also want to protect myself and prioritize myself, as well. Furthermore, when I get annoyed at someone, I tend to not be confrontational at first and will not talk to you for awhile in order to calm down and think over things that I want to say first. Another thing is that I am quite soft-spoken, especially around extroverted people, and am sometimes a doormat to them even though I don't want to be. I'm not so much of a people pleaser, but am someone who cares for others even if they hurt me. "

        "text": "Hi! My name is Ruby De Anda. I am 20 years old and a third year studying psychology and Spanish at Cal. I would describe myself as a quiet, but really chill and laid back person. What I mean by this is that I'm usually quiet when meeting new people, but once I feel comfortable with them, then I do talk a lot. And I say I'm chill and laid back because there really isn't that many things that bother me and I try to be understanding of everyone's situation and I always try to put myself in their shoes. I like to read and have some time to myself to de-stress but I also love outdoor activities like going camping, playing soccer, or exploring new cities. I'm also what some people describe as an \"adrenaline junkie\" but I'm not that high in the scale. I love stepping out of my comfort zone when it comes to doing things that others would never consider doing like going skydiving, riding the tallest and fastest rollercoasters, or go bungee jumping. When it comes to socializing, I think I'm more of an introvert since it is hard for me to talk to new people, mainly because sometimes I don't know how to start a conversation, or I am too self-aware of me and my surroundings and the thought that no one likes me or wants to be my friends gets to my head.

I leave my tasks until the last minute and I get stressed that I didn't do them before, and I say I'm never going to procrastinate again, yet I still do it, time and time again. When it comes to friendships, I think I am a good friend when I'm together with my friends, but when we're in college and in different towns sometimes I don't check up on them and it makes me feel like I am not the greatest friend. And another thing is that I think maybe I am too guarded and reserved since I don't talk about my feelings a lot, not with my friends or with my family and I am always careful about what I say, so I don't reveal too much. And I think this is kind of funny because I feel like I'm reserved because I don't trust people easily but at the same time, I think I am too naive and I always try to see the best in other people and I assume the best intentions of everyone even if I later find out that that's not the case.

Just so you know a little about me is that I can come off as very uninterested in what you may be saying at times because that means I want to be alone at that moment, however, when I am not in that sort of state I attentively listen to what you have to say and usually end up talking so much that you may be the one who will want to cut off the convo. I can be very sarcastic, I hate anything serious so I will instead make a joke or bring up a topic very jokingly. I go through episodes where I will suddenly not be motivated to do anything and episodes where I'm overly energetic and suddenly \"want to change myself and my actions and my life\". I can be very impulsive at times, like ill cut my hair or dye it or just drop money on something. I am very kind though and I tend to be there for your needs and problems, but I will not communicate mine with you because ill feel awkward or embarrassed or ashamed... however I will not judge you at all. I am very creative when it comes to anything interior though, I love arranging flowers and stuff. the only time u will see me is more at \"peace\" and not in my head so much, is because I also really tend to overthink, but will not do anything to fix the situation I may be overthinking.",

But also I tend to care about what others may think of me at times, which makes it hard for me to communicate or share my ideas, due to fear or judgment or something. I tend to avoid many people and will lie about why i cant go out because i just don't want to be around anyone. I tend to throw out little white lies when i do want to avoid an outing. kind of hard for me to make friends that go beyond because of my lack of communication. However, i do get a lot of ppl to tell me that they like being around me when i am around, but i lack confidence at times to truly believe it. "

While I have big ideas, I consider myself a realist, and somewhat of a pessimist. I am introspective, ruminative, and all other synonymous adjectives.

I am sensitive and emotional so I like to have conversations about any misunderstandings or other things I feel like I should communicate. I tend to avoid confrontation with people I like, however, will ultimately do so if necessary (of course, in a kind and polite manner). With people I don't know I am more likely to be confrontational. I think I am pretty chill about most things however, I appreciate when people let me know if they are unsure. ",

Also, I am quite honest with people I am not fond of. Especially when said person disrespects me or others around me I am not hesitant in sharing my feelings and or discomfort.

I do not like to talk a lot but I can hold a strong conversation, especially if we get to know each other. I am a very quiet and calm person. I do not like to disturb others with loud noises or interrupt your space. I am also a very serious person but I do have a good sense of humor. I consider myself chill and laid back because I accept everyone as they are and try to understand people as best as I can. I do not get mad easily or hold grudges, I am very forgiving, which leads me to being kind. I will always be kind to others and show them respect. My feelings at times may be intense, but I try my best to stay calm on the outside. I can be emotional at times when it comes to something that I am very passionate about. When I feel stressed I tend to think of the many outcomes that may arise from the situation I am in. My favorite activities include: sleeping, eating, soccer, and traveling. As I mentioned before, I am calm and that does translate to me sleeping a lot. I love trying out new foods and at times cooking. I played soccer for many years and although I do not play anymore, I enjoy watching the sport. Lastly, since my parents were unable to travel when I was younger, I enjoy being able to visit new places and learn about the culture/history of the place I am at! Looking forward to meeting you, roommate!",

Now as an adult, I feel that I have a lot of unhandled emotions and feelings and do not know how to best handle them. I did not know what depression was until a couple of years ago. I may get overwhelmed very easily by schoolwork or financial stress and take it out on my physical and mental health. By this, I mean that I binge eat or say bad things about myself. I try to not let anyone know or see how I am feeling because I feel like I would be a burden to others. Part of my calmness and shyness is due to the fact that I do not want to feel isolated from groups or people. This way I isolate myself without having to embarrass myself in front of others. Other than that, I am reluctant to outside help which is a bad aspect of my personality. I can be very stubborn when it comes to self-help or self-love. >.<"

I am highly judgmental of my peers, and am often disappointed that my closest friends have dropped out of college or otherwise drifted without much ambition.  I also have a tendency to sever friendships over minor issues that I believe would be difficult to resolve.  I sometimes resent that my mother holds me to a different (higher) standard than my sister.  I experienced a severe round of depression in high school but now am recovered.  I do not like engaging in problems or activities where I feel unintelligent.  If I cannot figure out the solution to a math problem, I want to see the solution rather than meticulously figure it out."

Oftentimes, it makes me behind on tasks that I need to do but, it makes me feel like I am a selfless person. Piggybacking on being selfless, I would say that I put myself behind other people. This is a major flaw since it's hard for me to discover things that I like but rather try to enjoy what other people enjoy. On the other hand, I found some things that I like to do by doing these tactics but, it's harder for me to truly discover myself. I would say that I am a pretty humourous individual. I always try to crack a joke when with others, maybe stemming from being a people-pleaser, but I found myself always referring back to making jokes. ",

From there, I grew up in Brooklyn and lived there until going to college. I played soccer all of my life (except college) and absolutely loved it -- although the Long Island soccer scene was extremely intense. I definitely am a very anxious person. I am a people pleaser and grew up as the family mediator, and have trouble setting boundaries/telling people what to do. I have trouble trusting others and I have trouble trusting my relationships with others. The more time I spend introspecting, I've come to realize I think I fear commitment the most and I need to work on that. "

I would say the first few minutes meeting someone I range and rove between quiet, chaotic, and oversharing depending on the initial first impressions. My friends would describe me as someone who is unconfident, self-deprecating, but is approachable, nice, and caring. I have my moments where I can make dumb jokes and bounce off of other people to keep a conversation going while other times I just blank and have no idea to continue with a conversation. I'm good with sitting in silence and enjoying someone else's presence. I tend to steal a lot of my jokes and humor from pop culture or media saying phrases like \"girlboss\" or \"crying and throwing up right now\". I dislike loud noises like cars, motercycles, music, and screaming. I'm not good with kids because I put them in the standards of people my age. I dislike talking about masculine things such as car. I don't drink or smoke, but I don't mind other people who do as long as it's not excessive or an addiction. My favorite ice break question is \"what's your third favorite reptile\" which was also stolen from a meme. I tend to believe people are good and try to be supportive as possible. I don't believe in astralogical signs or personality tests, and find it vain if anyone actually uses that to determine their life choices. I fluctuate between keeping to myself and oversharing. I tend to romanticize a lot of things like being a morning person, learning the violin, or having a picnic at Memorial Glade. I am a writer so that imaginative mind is probably why I romanticize a lot of things. I also have firm opinions about AAPI issues, and can ramble about it at 3am (which is what I did with a previous roommate). I am the type of person who needs to type everything down otherwise I will forget. I have like 3 to-do lists on my notes app because the previous list would be overwhelming and I just don't read it. I try to keep a drama free life. I'm bad at setting boundaries, but I try to be a good listener. I don't watch tv shows, movies, or actively listen to new music so I feel like I can be boring in that regard.",

I also tend to overshare a lot so I may accidentally \"trauma bond\" with people or scare people away for being very open. I can sometimes be very judgemental on certain qualities like people who party, smoke, drink, or do drugs as well as privileged people (white, upper class, male, etc.). I sometimes get very emotional that I make rash decision, lock myself in a room for hours on end, or starve myself and the worst part is I don't directly reach out. I don't think I have a lot of life experiences because I \"quarantined\" most of my life, so things like cooking or traveling seem foreign to me.

I am empathetic and on the sensitive side, and am very attentive to body language and tone. Words mean the most to me and I always try to treat them with care! I am (sometimes overly) practical and rational, and tend to approach most decisions by weighing all my options carefully before diving in. This is partly an effort from myself to be more decisive, although more often than not tends to make decisions even harder. I am active and a morning person, and I enjoy doing wholesome activities with my friends such as making brunch, going on runs, or spending time in the sunshine. Quality time and words of affirmation are definitely my love languages! I can also easy get wrapped into deep, meaningful conversations about mental health, the dairy industry, sociopolitical structures\u2014you name it! I find the best way to get close to someone else is to have these difficult conversations while maintaining a safe space for disagreement or for broadening my own perspectives.",

This is definetly somwthing to wirj on, as it is not something that should be considered normal for me. I also get emaotional very easily, as i feel things deeply. Not necessarily because im empathetic, but i pay very close attention to the things happening around me (which gets very tiring). I would consider myself ot be a big procrastinator also, which os probably caused by wanting everything to be perfect, so if i don't feel up to the task of \"perfection'\", ill just keep putting it off. I would say this need sot stop, as i put a lot of pressure on myself to do things as perfectly as possible and it sometimes causes me to rush things in ordet to get them done AND make them as perfect as possible. I learned in my PSYCH101m class last year that done is better than perfect, and i really need to get that into my head. one of my friends is really good at practicing this, as she doesn't care to make it totally perfect, if i employed this on myself, id be able to finish assignments 2 weeks early too!!"

I have an outward confident personality, but I do deal with a lot of insecurities that prevent me from fully expressing myself to everyone around me. I tend to doubt myself a lot, and require reassurance from loved ones in my life. I can be either very indecisive or incredibly insistent on one thing depending on the situation.

I think I have extra sensitive tear glands now, but also I can just be very in touch with my emotions and cannot keep them bottle up even when I try. I can get very mean when I'm angry because I don't always know when to stop talking. My mind gets very fuzzy when I'm overwhelmed with a negative emotion, causing me to usually say things I don't mean. I can be very lazy and procrastinate when I fear I'm going to fail. I don't always put my needs first, I put others before myself. That is a positive trait in some ways, but most of time it manifests itself as me not taking care of myself and expecting others to take care of me because I give more than I take. I am spoiled; I've had the privilege of always having grown up with money. Though I am genuinely trying to emphasize the value of money in my life, I know I live a lifestyle that comes from privilege, and I often wonder if I could survive without many of the material things I hold dear in my life. I probably could, but me not wanting to emphasizes the importance I place on inanimate, insignificant things."

However, with people I tend to talk more and become more animate with people I am comfortable with. I am an organized person and I like to take responsibility over my space. This includes frequent cleaning as I like to have a clean space, but I never expect my roommates to clean as much as I do. With feelings, I am a sympathetic person. I tend to get emotionally moved when watching movies, advertisement, or even just by hearing someone's story. I like to listen to others' story and I try hard to be emotionally present for my friends and family. However, I do get emotionally drained quickly as I often suppress my own emotions to not worry others. Activities that I like to do includes watching movies, cooking, cleaning, and going for a walk or a run alone. ",

That's not to say I am not open to experience. I love to try new things and even go to settings with large groups of people. I just tend to need me time to recuperate  after the event. I am kind and friendly to all. I know what it feels like to be excluded so I make sure I always make the people in my life feel included. Even if I appear shy to some, I never hold back on who I am and I always express myself unapologetically. The person I am with my family is the same person I am with my friends. I don't like to change myself for other people. I am also insecure. If you are having an off day or are not wanting to talk to me, I will assume I did something and it is my fault. I tend to compare myself to others although I am getting a lot better each day. I am the type of person to really listen. I will offer empathy and unsolicited advice because I genuinely understand your situation whether I have experienced something similar or not. With that said, I also am sensitive to people speaking over me or ignoring me. I tend to work on myself a lot. I am always trying to be my best self so you will see me read, write, and work out a lot. I am open to advice and welcome any interaction people have to offer.",

It takes a lot to get me angry but when I am angry, I get incredibly petty and mean. Despite being insecure, I have had many instances in my life where I thought of myself as better than others. "

I am a very social person; while I am okay being by myself I would rather spend time with people who are important to me and to who I feel close. However, I would rather be alone than be with someone who I did not like. I am usually very organized in my life and I am a big planner. I think sometimes I try to impress other people because I feel inadequate in myself. In my free time, I like to either hang out with friends or get outdoors so that I can clear my head a little bit. One of my favorite activities to do is to go on hikes out in the middle of nowhere and disconnect from work, school, and technology. I am also very interested in photography. I really like to take pictures both of people and of landscapes. I like to try to capture the emotion that I or the person I am photographing is feeling at the moment. I also like to take pictures because then I can go back to them later and relive some of my favorite times. My friends describe me as pretty funny and outgoing, however, it does sometimes take me a little bit to warm up to someone new. I can be somewhat shy when first meeting someone new, which can at times keep me from making friends with whom I would like to or stop me from talking to someone who I want to be friends with or get to know better. I think that I am also a very anxious person, I tend to think about things that others might not. For instance, I may think about how a text message comes off before I send it or wonder if something is wrong if my friend texts me and their wording is slightly off. I am pretty goal driven and I think I am able to keep myself always focused on the next goal really well, which may be a good or a bad thing, I'm not really sure haha. However, I think that is a pretty apt description of myself. Oh yeah, I am also a big music fan and I love indie rock and a little bit of rap.",

That doesn't necessarily mean that I need to have the best clothes or the newest phone, however, I think I can be kind of superficial when thinking about myself and others.

I do sometimes feel like people do not actually like me and that they are just kind of putting up with me which makes me feel really shitty, but I do think it is simply just an anxiety thing. Speaking of anxiety, I am incredibly clean, almost too clean that it is kind of a problem. I do not like when people are messy, I have a hard time dealing with them because I always feel the need to clean up after them. I honestly love cleaning though so it works out sometimes, just when they seem to disregard me it stinks. I care about my family more than anything, they are the most important thing to me, I could not be more devoted to the people I care about. I feel like they are the ones who have shaped me in to who I am today so I owe them so much. I am the fourth out of five children, but I somehow feel like I have more older sibling energy. I am crazy mature for my age (or so I have been told before and also feel the same) and I can sometimes get annoyed with inmature people aka people my own age. It is a little unfair, but I had an unfair advantage with having three older siblings to look up to my whole life. I am also a theatre kid, although that pains me to say. I like to say I am not a typical theatre kid because I have so many more layers to me, I was also an athlete my entire life and more of a popular kid. But deep down, theatre is my life now and I could not feel more at home when I am on a stage. It is also where I get to feel like myself the most, even when I am portraying characters that are very different than who I am, that makes it all the more fun.",

With that said sometimes I can come off as unfriendly when I am getting to know someone for the first time. Moreover I enjoy listening to classic rock/indie/pop music. I am a big Doors, Zeppelin, Dire Straits fan, I find that the music reflects my groovy yet odd personality. One of the things I enjoy most in life is listening to my record collection as I am sipping on some cabernet sauvignon (duh I'm from wine country) and painting. I am not a morning person and there are days where I am not in the happiest of moods so on days like these I like to have some quiet time for myself. If you find me behaving moody/quiet it's not that another person did something to upset me (typically) it's more that I am feeling very anxious and it is affecting my entire behavior. ",

I enjoy the company of men over women because I feel more natural around them.

I also love supporting and assisting when my friends and family are feeling down. I would drop all of my plans for a friend in need.

I am happy most of the time and try to make people around me feel loved through bringing flowers or asking about their life and going to things that are important to them. I don't judge people immediately, it takes a while for an opinion to form. I am clean, and like to mop the floors + vacuum at least once a week, and have this weird obsession with cleaning toilets because it's so satisfying. I love meeting new people and doing new activities with various groups because it's truly a bonding moment and there's so much to see and do. I like baking for other people, focaccia, tres leches, pumpkin mochi, and especially spend my time cooking for the homeless and finding materials that they need like menstrual products or even just water. I believe that I am so priveledged and so I want to and feel like I have so much opportunity to give back. I love joking around and trying to make people laugh even though I'm awkward at times. I would say some personality traits is being adventurous because I am always down to do anything, confident, creative, optimistic, and adaptable. I love people, genuinely, and almost everyday, I wake up so excited to see what comes next, welcoming the bad and good because it all makes me grow into the person I'm meant to be. I'm religious and have been a Christian my whole life but really devoted myself to God when I became a sophomore in college two years ago. I'd say that has taught me a lot and gotten me through some really hard times and continues to. I've grown a lot and believe in growing everyday and having an open mind to whatever comes my way :) I'm also extremely grateful to even be alive, I thing that's one privilege I take for granted but with some close friends and family passing away recently, I thing I value waking up each morning more than ever before.

When I do get out though, I feel fine, but when I confine myself during those times, the aloneness kicks in and I start to overthink more. Another negative aspect of my personality is that it's hard for me to tell the truth sometimes, I think that I can only say so much when it comes to someone expressing their issues, but at some point, I do get frustrated because their struggles from my point of view is something that they can fix or something that can have steps taken in order for it to get better. So when people don't take those steps or constantly place burdens on others, I think it's unhealthy, and sometimes I am more inpatient than I'd like to be. I want to help but I do believe there is a limit to helping other get through their problems. Also, I get frustrated when people don't realize their priveledge and actually flat out deny that they have any. I also get curious when people speak on things when they don't know the whole story. I will not put in effort where effort isn't put into me after trying for so hard. I've grown and realized that I put my energy into people and things that will never put the same energy back and it hurts me so bad in the end. I only have so much to give and so much positvity and to surround myself with not that, is just not what I want to do in my life. "

I like to keep things tidy, so my room is pretty organized upon first glance, but if you pull open the drawers, it's super messy.",

I'd prefer having a close group of friends then having a large group of people I don't really know. This partly stems from me being the anxious person I am. I used to be extremely insecure growing up. However, now I tend to just mind my own business and let everybody do their own thing. I can live without being a super social creature. I don't have the materialistic desires and love for sex, drugs, and money. Simplicity is preferable in my life. People should prioritize their health and well-being because that's everything. I occasionally play sports and other games because of my competitive nature. However, when it comes to academics and other skills in life I guess I have an inferiority complex. The reason behind this is because of my lack of life experience and knowledge of the world. I didn't get the best education and learn much useful skills that I see the people around me have. A part of me realizes I'm quiet because of this and i let everyone else do the talking so they don't see my incompetence.  At the end of the day, life is what it is. ",

But I call this \u201creading the room\u201d. With this I\u2019m just observing the scene and people in front of me to decide if I feel comfortable showing my more outgoing side. I would say I\u2019m a very observant and judicious person. My more outgoing side is the inner class clown, jokester in me. I love laughing and making people laugh.  I like being silly and just living in an \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d moment where I could completely not care less about what I might be perceived as. I would say I\u2019m a generous, compassionate, and loyal person to the people around me. I maybe am not so verbally affectionate naturally so when I am, it is because I am reminding myself to grow as a person. I am a faithful hardworking, driven, resilient, and passionate person. These traits guide me through my daily life, allowing me in challenging moments to chose my morals, integrity, and love when I feel the trials and tribulations of life. I think I can be a irritable person and maybe have a short tolerance for certain behaviors. I am a blunt and honest person but typically chose to be polite and careful with my words in moments like this. I would say I am an intentional person. I would say I can be sensitive, and feel things very deeply. ",

If you do something that bothers me I will probably not say anything until it becomes a habit. I am sorry about that. I am however, optimistic that I can improve this and learn to become more confrontational. My fear is that being confrontational will make others look down on me, and this probably circles back to me caring too much about what others think about.

I try to smile and laugh as much as I can when I am around others because I feel like life is too short to be upset. What sucks is that I am actually a closeted pessimistic person so when I am alone I think about how life can go south quickly. Talking to people and smiling with them does reinforce facial feedback and allows me to feel more optimistic in the moment though. Another thing about me is that I am sort of a people pleaser, so I will try my best to make others happy because that also brings me joy and purpose in life.

On one hand, I love the security of my own room and the relaxing nature of it all as I just bask in the warmth of the bathtub as I enjoy a nice novel. I also enjoy challenging myself and commiting to new activites that I've never done before (bonus point if it's something that has to do with my fears, like paragliding) and meeting both new people and old friends, although I may need a good recharge after. I think I was inclined to be like the former in the past, but meeting a lot of interesting and thriving individuals has made me a \"learned extrovert\", if that makes any sense. I love to have my calendar and day structured out, yet I also enjoy the impromptu meetings and always seem to forget something important on a daily basis.\nI guess if there's any takeaways from this, it's that I'm always down to try something new and I'll be there no matter what!",

I often struggle with the issue of self-esteem, and my lack of respect for myself (especially in settings that are stressful) cause me to hesitate a lot and lose opportunities/friends/the flow of conversation. I always lacked-self confidence, mostly because I'm not always sure I can do well in the face of uncertainty, and I also don't deal with uncertainty well in general because of this, especially when it comes to the job market today (which has been having a lot of negative press in light of the pandemic and the recession). I'm always afraid of losing things that are both animate and inanimate, no matter how close I am emotionally to it, and this attachment causes me to have a mild hoarding issue with my things and makes me feel extremely sad some days."

I would say that I am pretty open to new experiences and have a creative mind, which makes things like change not so bad for me. However, I like to be in control of things so if there is change I want to be the one who initiated it. I think I'm highly empathetic, and care for animals and other people a lot. I would say that I'm thoughtful. Because I view myself as creative, I like to think I do creative things like play the piano (make/play music), or do my makeup in new ways. One thing though is that I worry quite often and think of myself as an anxious person. I think I am pretty judgemental as well, of everything. In the way that if someone does something I don't like or view as rude, I make note of it. However, I also can change my mind easily if someone does something reedeeming (to me). ",

For example, if I want someone to like me, I will compliment their outfit even if I don't think it's cute. So you can make a judgement whether you think that is really bad or not. But when I say dishonest, that's what I mean, not really bad, but I guess not technically honest.  "

I am sometimes forgetful too, but like previously I just need a small nudge. I am passionate about my hobbies and enjoyments such as gaming and caring for my cat. I find it difficult to get past the initial awkward stage when I first meet someone, which means I don't have that many friends. I see this as a challenge though and this semester I am trying to get better at speaking to new people and putting myself out there and escaping my shell. I dislike parties, they are too loud and too many bodies makes for a very uncomfortable and sweaty experience. I much rather prefer small get togethers with my closer friends. I believe in quality over quanitity, and I am proud to say that my friends are all my closest. I strongly believe as well that good friends do not need to speak to each other every day, and can truly connect without needing any verbal communication. I am not only loyal to my friends, but my family as well and we share a tight bond as well. I often find myself in doubt because I wonder if I can be a bit too much though and even fake at times, but I see it as an opportunity to grow my character. ",

I love talking to people and gain a lot of joy and energy from it, but my anxiety and nerves make me worried that I will say the wrong thing. Therefore, I come off as shy. I would say that I am artistic - I love music and art. I play multiple instruments, and I also enjoy painting even if I am not so good at it. I am generally an optimist and enjoy looking on the bright side of things. I have trouble with this when the anxiety and nerves hit, but I want to help people (and myself) feel better so I try to be as optimistic as possible. I believe I am kind and would sacrifice a lot for others. This might just mean that I am a people pleaser though. I am talkative when I enjoy the subject. I would say I am quiet to new people. I can act confident when I need to but this is a rare occurrence. I am falsely open - I share things that I have already come to terms with and not things that I have not. I would call myself an organized mess, but I am trying to fix that. I have a partner that I care very much for, and while she is long distance, I do everything in my power to continue and strengthen that connection. I enjoy taking walks. I am not particularly fit, but I do what I can and enjoy. I need to get better about doing the dishes. I genuinely love people and I think that, for the most part, they like me. I am a bit insecure but I am trying to get over this. I think that I am hilarious. I like to think that I am a hard worker and am a bit ambitious. I tend to be thought of as smart by my friends at home, but this is everyone at Berkeley. I really just want to help people after college and be happy with my life. I don't want my career to be my entire world and I think that my friends and family are most important to me.",

These thoughts harm my relationships with others because that is what they tend to be about. I get stressed easily as a result and I tend to put too much on my plate. I am inconsistent - I will have a goal but have difficulty sticking to it, even if I desperately want to do so. I am a perfectionist and don't like things unless they are perfect. I tend to try and mimick those around me, creating the air of a falsely close relationship that I have not achieved. This can come across as mean. I get guilty very easy. I have body image issues and I talk about it.  I procrastinate and then get upset for how little time I have. I have a short fuse sometimes."

        "text": "Hello! My name is Kailiyah Hauser. I am a generally quiet and shy person who tends to keep to themselves. However, even though I am not outgoing and I am introverted, I do enjoy social connection with a small number of friends and family. I tend to have fewer deeper relationships than more casual relationships. When I spend time with people, I like to do things together that allow us to bond or get to know one another better. For instance, cooking together, or watching a show together than we can then discuss. My favorite things to do, regardless of whether they are done with others, are reading, writing, cooking, baking, eating, knitting, hiking, spending time in nature, traveling, and watching certain shows (especially cooking shows or comfort shows/movies that I have seen before). I tend to rewatch and reread things for comfort. I have anxiety that can be pretty debilitating, and I have found some things that help ground me, like Brooklyn 99 and Harry Potter. I have always had struggles with my mental health, including a history of obsessive compulsive disorder, an eating disorder, depression, and anxiety. I often experience sensory overload and will have to take time in a dark and quiet space to return to my more balanced self.\n\nIn a living space, I am clean and organized. My room always has everything put away, and disorder in my room bothers me. It makes me feel more anxious and less confident in my ability to take care of myself, so I strive to have order in my environment to aid coherence in my thoughts. I really like to have my own space so I can manage my mental health, decompress after social interaction, and keep my environment the way I like it. \n\nI am considerate and empathetic. I spend a lot of time thinking about others, and strive to be helpful and kind in every situation. I really value social connection, and do my best to understand the multifaceted nature of people beyond making broad assumptions. \n\nSome of the things that bother me include people who are inconsiderate (play their media too loud in shared spaces, lack of consideration for others' time (lateness, etc.) leave messes, etc.), driving, and people interrupting me while I'm reading.",

I devoted a lot of the space in the last page to describing negative aspects of my personality (including my struggles with mental health), and I think that says a lot about my assumptions about myself. I did touch on positive aspects of my personality, like my love for deep connection and motivation to help and love others, but some other positive aspects of my personality include my genuine care for the people around me, my ability to read people really well, my love of books, my passion for food, and my willingness to take time for others. \n\nHowever, some negative characteristics that I struggle with include my propensity to jealousy and comparing myself to other people. I often struggle with feeling like I am not good enough, or feeling inferior when other people are successful. I do not like this about myself, and I constantly am doing work to try and actively counteract that mindset when it arises. \n\nI also have a tendency to fall into my overpowering emotions. Being empathetic to a fault and emotionally intelligent comes with extremely intense emotions, and in combination with my anxiety, this can be really debilitating. I often fall into despair about the human condition, the society in which we live, and about my own life, and I struggle to pull myself back towards positivity. \n\nI also struggle with anger for my family that I have not yet worked through.

I, myself, don't see this as a negative because it isn't how I think of myself, but rather how others think of me. But I understand if this is a negative. Another negative is I sometimes may be too blunt to the point where I don't say anything good that I don't want to say or I feel is superficial. This may make people think that I am too serious and a bit mean. Lastly, I am very introverted and don't like to talk much. I don't see this as a negative trait, but our current society definitely sees introversion as a negative trait. "

This means that I can come off as a bit reserved, but give me some time to warm up to you and you'll find I'm actually relatively talkative and extroverted. Every now and then I would say I tend to fall into gossip, but I try to stay drama-free and surround myself with more positivity. I have a very strong work ethic\u2013some people would say I don't know how to stop working. When I work, I prefer to work alone especially if it's on a solo assignment, as well as in silence or with my headphones in. Even if I have my headphones in while I'm working, I don't have music on. It's more to drown out all the sounds and make sure no one is talking to me (a bit weird, I know). I'm very nervous of your first impression of me. I really don't want to be perceived as strange or rude or anything negative, which in turn might end up with me acting more strange than I might have intended. I have some tics, so you might hear me clearing my throat when I am nervous, or cracking my knuckles a bunch, or raising my eyebrows unintentionally. I love going on walks and hikes, going to the gym (but only if I'm comfortable with the people there), trying new coffee shops, and hanging out with my friends. I also love coding and working on my neuroscience research, painting, and baking.",

I always want the best for myself, but I like portraying myself as a positive person, so I never let my jealousy show when my friends get a job that I don't or get a better grade than me, even though I feel jealous deep down. I'm always the happiest when I do the best, and this could be the result of my upbringing with a tiger mom, where I would be scolded for getting anything less than an A and continuously compared to my peers despite being a hard-working student myself. I put myself down a lot, but I hide it in jokes about my appearance and personality to play off the fact that I'm upset with myself as a person. I'm easily irritable, and while I said I prefer to be drama-free, my gossip-y nature ends up with me putting myself in situations where I'm called out for sharing unnecessary secrets and speaking rudely of my own friends."

        "text": "I am introverted, usually quite quiet, and bookish, though I do need to spend time around people to \"drain my battery\" that I spend recharging on my own. My attention span is quite limited: I love to read, but little sounds, activity in another room, noises and lights outside, or my own wandering mind frequently prevent me from being able to make it far in books. I am often quiet while my trains of thought \"ping-pongs\" around from one idea to another, giving some the impression that I come to ideas or thoughts quite randomly. Others would describe me as nice, compassionate, empathetic, and I agree with these assessments; I actively work toward empathy with others the vast majority of the time, almost constantly playing the advocate for victims and underdogs. However, i) I find this level of empathy very challenging to maintain, as it becomes very tiresome without having time to spend by myself; and ii) internally, I often find it incredibly difficult to empathize emotionally or socially with others, and am frequently acting based on what I think am empathetic person would do, rather than acting solely on empathy. I am a generally agreeable person, and aim to avoid conflict where it arises; often, I try to make the most people in a given group happy, even at the cost to the minority and myself - in this respect, I'm a very \"go with the flow\" kind of person. I don't need excessive plans to have a good time and enjoy myself, and in most cases a quiet day/night at home - movies, books, boardgames, walks, hikes - is my ideal way to spend time, as opposed to going out. Despite this, I am quick to annoyance, misunderstanding, and anger; however, I am also quick to reflect and try to understand if I am the one at fault for a social situation going sour. This often leads to feelings of guilt, shame, and inferiority, and sometimes further mistrust. Example: i) Person A does something that disagrees with me in a way I feel should be obvious; ii) I get mad or stressed, but stay quiet about it; iii) I quickly think of ways that I may be misinterpreting Person A's actions/intentions, and that why I would get upset is *not* obvious to them; iv) I try to move forward through life consciously thinking about how I must have been in the wrong. I am generally a little depressed and lack motivation to get started on projects, but I try to keep this from showing externally as much as possible. Finally, care deeply about genuineness and sincerity, and don't like acts and behaviors that ring hollow or are generally meaningless - one reason why I find it difficult to understand people of my own generation is, despite \"woke culture\" and leading with compassion, a social adherence to cynicism and falseness - the idea of \"finstagram\", the act of dressing \"stylishly\" at the cost of \"comfort\", and social media filters are all things that I find difficult for myself to partake in because, while I understand why these and other things are done, they don't make intuitive sense to me, so maybe that means my personality is a bit socially conservative, though my political and financial ideology is incredibly liberal.

I feel a lot of imposter syndrome as a human being living in our social society; I try to be as empathetic as possible, but often find myself hugely lacking in my ability to empathize. I can be a bit of a germ-a-phobe and am generally mistrustful of others' senses of cleanliness; on the opposite side of things, I'm generally not a neat person, and don't often leave things in the same spot as when I found them. I try to actively correct for this, though. What else? I'm easy to \"shut-down\" at the first sign that I've offended someone or made someone feel uncomfortable, which in many cases only leads to others feeling bad that they've made me feel bad which (you guessed it) leads to more feeling bad on my part. I'm easy to start spiraling into self-loathing when I've made others upset, or even spiralling just in an existential way. However, I've always been able to pick myself up out of those darker places.

I am a very independent person as I have leave my home and family behind when I was 13 to study aboard until now, so I think I can take care of myself and other people around me well. My friends tell me that I have a sense of humor and smiles a lot, which I think is a plus. Yet I also have a sensitive side of me that people seldom notice. In general, I am a really open minded person and respect the way people are, because I believe that if I don't know that person's story and how they grew up, I shouldn't make irrational and possible untrue judgement about them, so I try my best to limit my judgements. Also, I have been told that I am a really good listener and trustworthy friend, I guess that's because I really value relationships and emotions, and would like to imagine if I'm in that situation what would I want my friend to do. Enough of the goods, I am very stubborn person as I upheld my values and doesn't get influenced easily. Also, I could be lazy and not motivated sometimes, which I always hope I could change this.

I also like to bake, but haven't been able to very much in college. So instead, I've recently liked making fun meals for myself. I also really like to listen to music, sing (not very well at all), and drive. It's even better if I can listen to music and sing along while driving. I really like to explore cities, specifically cool dessert shops or restaurants. According to my friends, I also like a lot of 'useless knick knacks' which is very accurate. ",

I also swear a lot, which some people consider to be negative, and have a scathing sense of humour with those I am close to that I feel can sometimes come off as harsh. I think I have a little bit of a quick temper, however I never hold a grudge and get over my annoyance at others pretty quickly. I can be overly judgemental sometimes, especially of men which I think is a little unfair, but I suppose it is because I perceive danger from them more. I have a tendency for stress and anxiety as I mentioned before, and have had panic attacks in the past, which often tend to be triggered by traveling, which I have to do a lot because my family is in England and on the east and west coast of the US."

I like talking to people and I also feel more comfortable sitting in silence with others than alone. I enjoy having both deep connections with others and a wide social network of friends and acquaintances. At the same time, I highly value alone time because it pushes me out of my comfort zone and I am often at my most productive and healthy in terms of routine when alone. I much prefer to have my own room because of the freedom it gives me to structure my time and also to relax and let go of the social energy I carry with me most of the time. In general, I would say I am a very open person\u2013I consider new ideas and change my mind in light of new information. However, sometimes I still bristle when faced with things that conflict with strongly held beliefs and expectations. I am not a very conscientious person\u2013I tend to be forgetful and make silly mistakes. However, I tend to do well in school because I am motivated to succeed and when I do focus I can be very productive. As I mentioned previously, I am fairly extroverted. However, I do also sometimes feel awkward and self-conscious when interacting with others. I would say I am a pretty nice, kind, and empathetic person when it comes to my intentions. I care a lot about not hurting people's feelings and trying to behave ethically. I also make an effort to approach people with positive energy. However, sometimes stress and/or a lack of conscientiousness lead me to behave in a way that comes off as mean or at least emotionally unaware. I believe I can be very neurotic\u2013I have struggled with anxiety and depression off and on throughout my life and to this day one small thing can put me in a negative state of mind which becomes hard to escape. However, others have also told me that I handle problems well and tend to have a very positive and mature outlook on life. I think I have been able to moderate my neuroticism with an intentionally positive outlook at times. ",

Sometimes I resent other people who are close to me as a product of my own internal pain\u2013I resent them when I perceive them as being better than me. I got bullied a lot as a kid and I guess I have a \"chip on my shoulder.\" I still feel a need sometimes to prove myself in some way\u2014as the most masculine person in the room? The smartest? The most successful? The worst person to pick a fight with? It changes but I do believe that I often have an unhealthy focus on how others perceive me and it can lead me to behave in negative ways. Ultimately, I think this mindset stems from a need to prove to myself that I am strong, successful, \"masculine\"\u2013basically the opposite of the kid who got bullied.

I am charismatic, funny, and intelligent. I am kind to others. I am disciplined and focus on my goals and do everything I can to achieve them. I am empathetic and self-aware, almost to a fault. I often feel that I feel too much, and am highly susceptible to this. I also often feel anxious. Because of my self-awareness, I am able to try and conceptualize how others feel and think of me, and this often leads to critical assessment of myself. Therefore, I often hold myself back from expressing parts of myself, and often, large parts of myself remain unexpressed. This leads to a lot of feelings of displeasure and dissonance inside myself. I am kind, but do not always extend that kindness to myself. I am creative, I like to express myself through my creative hobbies. I am able to lighten the mood in most situations. I am fun-loving, but also work hard to complete what is expected of me. I often feel self-conscious and feel I can be a bit high-strung when stressed or feeling self-conscious. I want to feel better about myself and the things I do, which leads me to work hard in my life. I treat others with respect, care, and grace. I struggle to do the same with myself. I have a strong moral compass, and am able to differentiate right from wrong. Because of my self-awareness and empathy, when I do do something I find morally wrong, I quickly feel guilt and shame, especially after placing myself in the perspective of the other person. I find myself always wanting to improve from the person I am now. Sometimes this causes me to not enjoy the present moment, or love and appreciate who I am now. I do not have this same attitude with others, instead loving and accepting them as they are most of the time. ",

However, I do often judge myself, and this in turn does lead me to also judge others at times, although, the judgment I pass on others is not as severe as what I turn upon myself. This can make me seem self-deprecating to others, and give other people a worsened or lowered perception of who I am. I often find myself fearing that others will not like me, and so will not give them the opportunity to make that decision for themselves, because I repress or silence myself. This especially comes off in front of new people. Sometimes, I get so stuck in my own head and imagination of how others see and think of me, that I am unable to express myself or be involved in social interactions. This is a challenge I have faced for my entire life, and one I am constantly pushing against and working on in my own life. I am slow to make judgments about others, but quick to do so with myself. I am often unable to forgive myself for things that were either out of my control, or that have happened in the past and are now unchangeable. I feel a high sense of responsibility, to the point where I worry that it can be overbearing at times. I overthink to the point of stressing myself out. "

I often love to socialize and be in the company of my friends often but I also highly appreciate the alone time I can get, as too much socializing can cause overstimulation. I guess you could call me an extrovert with introvert tendencies. I am not very fond of the sunlight or heat, but I thrive where it is cold and chilly. I have always been like this, and this is why San Francisco weather is perfect for me. I love to watch movies, read books, and try new places to eat food. I have specific restaurants and shows/movies which give me a lot of happiness, thus creating a familiar routine in going back to the same places or entertainment. I am a creature of habit which thus ties into my inability to quickly adapt to change. On the other hand, I am a very collaborative person and also I may seem rigid, I try my utmost hardest to be as accommodating as I can for other people, which can help when I begin to live with them as I am doing right now in college.

I have realized that I tend to be manipulative when I desire something, using \"psychological tricks\" to my advantage. My self-presentation is often not genuine as I desire for people to look at me in a certain \"favorable\" way. I can be deceiving and cunning (fake). I tend to be in a negative emotional state often even though I don't externalize it and pretend that I am happy. I tend to blame others for situations in which I was the culprit to relieve psychological distress. "

        "text": "I am an introvert. That's the adjective that always comes to mind first when I'm asked to describe myself. I am more shy than outgoing, which can often come across as just being quiet. I like spending time alone and with other people, but if I have been doing one of those more than the other, I start to notice that I miss either solitude or having company. I am very careful to be quiet and unobtrusive, especially in the context of having roommates. I very rarely listen to music or play things without headphones, even if I am home alone. A lot of my hobbies involve working on my own, most of them are also quiet if not totally silent. If I am drawing or painting or sometimes reading, I can stay focused on that for hours without noticing that time is passing. I tend to see things in black and white terms, so I have to consciously exert effort to see things in a more nuanced way. As I'm writing this, I can't stop looking down at the timer counting down right below the box. I can be very talkative if I am comfortable with someone, often taking a long time to get to the point, if I ever get to it. I try really hard to not interrupt people, I used to do it a lot, and until it was pointed out to me, I didn't notice. I am very pessimistic, I've been cynical even since I was little. I am superstitious in a lot of ways, but I am also scornful of myself for believing in things like jinxes and bad luck and astrology, even though they're fairly harmless. I am very conscious of myself and worry about the way I'm coming across, I worry a lot about being irritating or seeming unkind. My neutral face and stance make me seem alternatively angry or sad, so I don't think I'm very approachable, and I used to hate that. If I catch myself thinking in a way that's very judgmental or mean or negative, I try to reframe it in a more positive light, since my automatic tendency is to assume the worst. I draw every day, and I have to remind myself that if I am enjoying something, it is worthwhile. ",

I make self deprecating jokes and dark humor at my own expense that makes people uncomfortable before I can annoy them just by being myself. I intellectualize my emotions so I don't have to experience them. I do not think I am a nice person. I don't know if I'm a good person, but it's never been all that concerning to me that I might not be good. I think I am more like my father, and I hate that. I project expectations onto other people that aren't fair to them. I have no idea what I'm really like, even writing this I feel like I'm making it up or lying somehow. I wallow in negativity and ignore hope and help in favor of staying in the bad place I'm in. I never shut up, I have to be told to stop talking or interrupting in order for my brain to finally stop spitting out words. I use my mental illnesses as a crutch and as excuses for why I'm not happy or better. I don't think I'll ever be happy, and I don't try to be. "

I am pretty honest and can also be blunt sometimes, but for the vast majority of the time I am really conscious of other people's feelings and try to do my best to cater towards other people. I try to be kind and generous when I can and I value friends who also feel that it is important to do so. I like to meet to new people often and will generally be open to trying new things/experiences. I have two sides: one where I enjoy large crowds and lots of stimulation (eg. concerts) and the other where I can really appreciate the peace and quiet of picnicing on the glade with good company. Back at home, my favourite thing to do would be to go to the beach with some friends or even by myself with a good book. In my free time, I like going to the gym and playing volleyball or basketball, as well as reading, drawing, and baking if I'm not too pre-occupied with studies. When it comes to school, I think I have high standards and have a hard time being satisfied with myself so I tend to get anxious and stressed easily, despite my best efforts to relax. I also cry very easily, whether it's from watching a sad movie or from being frustrated with how my life is going. Overall, I love my family, friends, and appreciating life in general.",

However, if I were to expand on it I would say that the T to F percentage for my MBTI is maybe around 80ish percent or more F (feeling). This is representative of when I said I can get too emotional sometimes. My emotions can sometimes cloud my decision-making, which makes me even more indecisive than an average indecisive person. I can apply emotions to situations and decisions that shouldn't be emotional. I also struggle with depression and anxiety, which makes it difficult to be timely. This may come off as irresponsible, but to be honest I think it has less to do with irresponsibility and more with overthinking and obsessive/perfectionist behavior (which I guess one could say is irresponsible).  Regardless, I'm very aware of these shortcomings and I'm working on them! "

I struggle to truly feel as though i connect with people and would rather retreat into myself than deal with many of my emotions. in many social situations feel as though I am constantly on the outside of things looking in, despite this i do try and be there for people and can sometimes take on too much emotional responsibility when it comes to others.  i am also quite scared of my stronger emotions, especially the ability to get angry, and while i have a very quick temper, i would rather shut down and not react to anything instead of letting my anger overwhelm me which often leads me to feel very numb.   I need time and space to myself and often will lock myself away in my room for hours on end and not engage with anyone, however, i don't necessarily like to be alone. I want to be kind and i want to be good friends with people, but i am inexperianced in opening up.",

I'd describe myself as someone who is very compassionate, is always conscientious of how others might be feeling (I like to make sure everyone feels included in the conversation and, more generally, comfortable), and who values above all else authenticity and honesty. I am arguably overly-trusting, which is a good and a bad thing at times; I am very sociable, love good conversation, and especially enjoy meeting new people. In this way, I'd say I'm very gregarious and open to new things- adventurous. However, I am also more often than not very inquisitive about the world around me and, even moreso, curious about what this life holds for me and why things, including personality, are the way they are. I am fascinated and deeply appreciative of all of our unique individual differences which, I feel, actually connect us in the sense that while we have such differences in traits, for example, these differences merely contribute to a difference in the way we see the world and life more generally- our perception(s) of our life situation(s). When making friends or meeting new people more broadly, I always seek to learn from others, as I believe everyone to be my superior in at least one area- not necessarily intellectually, but in at least one area of life such as spirituality, etc. Ultimately, I'd describe myself as someone who is just along for the ride of life, who has no expectations for life, and who is contented by whatever I have, am given, or is thrown my way; for this reason, I am also highly resilient. Anyway, that's a little about me! Hope this is a helpful introduction. :) ",

It is, however, extremely difficult for me to reach this negative state: I am a through-and-through optimist who has God in my life, who gives me such purpose and meaning each and every day! Even with this optimistic view of life, though, I sometimes become negative when I feel that I'm getting nothing done, especially after I've been working on it for a long time (frustration would be the word to best describe this I think). I am also very slow to process things, which is not necessarily a bad thing, since it helps me really think things through, and has helped foster a patience and reverence towards myself and, more specially, towards moving at my own pace. I tend to take a long time on things, as mentioned earlier, in large part because I am a perfectionist; I would also consider myself a little OCD, in that I like things neat and tidy, including my own handwriting (in fact, in high school I used to rewrite a word completely if it wasn't \"pretty\" or \"perfect\" enough for my standards- I was literally called the \"human typewriter\" for my then-perfect handwriting. This is not as true to this day since I am now perfectly fine with messy handwriting, but just thought I'd mention it for additional context). "

        "text": "Good listener, empathetic, respectful, cute, and open-minded; those adjectives I have heard associated with my personality when someone asks what type of person I am to those who have interacted with me. The combination of these five describes how I typically identify with and try to portray. People feel at ease when they talk to me about \"deep\" subjects because I become invested in what they are communicating to me which leads me to ask questions. By doing this, I achieve people for people to feel listened to because that is how I would like to be treated as well. This leads me to the next point: empathy. Sometimes I don't know if it is a quality or or curse because I am able to put myself in other people's shoes to the point where I literally feel the problem to be my own problem. However, this becomes a blessing when it's an achievement because I feel the same amount of joy for them as they do for the achievement. I think that people think I am cute because it is a combination of shyness, empathy, and respect that they associate with the concept of cuteness (my big doe eyes may also be a factor.) Lastly, while I do have extremely strong values, I truly believe that open-mindedness is a key to getting along with most people regardless of whether they have contrasting perspectives about life. Really understanding what it is that people believe and why they are that way can lead to having a more harmonious life in theory. Nevertheless, in the past couple of years, my radicalization of these ideals has led me to be more selective of the people that I hang out with and therefore to create an image of myself to be more distant or shy than the average extrovert, but more social than an introvert.",

Nonetheless, I am resilient and I will continue to keep trying even if I am a little more discouraged than the first time. I always want to get along with people. Others have said that I like being \"the center of attention,\" but I think a more accurate description is that I enjoy having someone's attention on me, even if it is only one person in the entire group.

Or I get upset when I hear about one of my friends going to a party even though my great distance from them prevents me from receiving an invitation in the first place. Though unreasonable, a lot of my hatred for other people and things comes from jealousy. Another trait that I deem negative is that I get overwhelmed easily and have a hard time calming myself down. Similar to the growth that comes from jealousy, my stress causes me to lash out at people and things that do not have anything to do with it. All the while, I am conscious and regretful of my actions but cannot stop them. Making me feel even more guilty and embarrassed. "

I have a positive outlook on life and am usually on the go. I am spiritual, but not formally religious, and practice yoga and meditation often. I am type-A in that I know what I like and I am not afraid to go after that which is important to me. I am definitely an extravert and have a harder time being alone than being with other people. I go to bed early and wake up early and am usually out the door before 7am, taking my dogs for a walk. I am aesthetically-minded and love to have my home reflect the things I find most inspiring and beautiful. I have many plants and books and candles and I love to listen to. music as I am moving throughout my day. I am tidy, but not overly controlling about cleanliness. It is more important to me that things look beautiful than that things be perfectly spotless. I love the arts and have a tendency to be quite dramatic and emotional. I prefer to talk through difficult feelings than hold in resentments. I don't do well with conflict and am always looking for ways to avoid or de-escalate any sort of anger or upset. I love animals and kids and struggle with individual's who focus on things being half empty rather than half full. I have high standards when it comes to my own level of achievment and can get neurotic and stressed out around deadlines and accomplishments. I do not tolerate my own failures very well and can get down on myself when I am not living up to my own expectations. This intensity can bleed into my relationships with those I feel most dependent on and I can, at times, be controlling. In generally, I am expressive, emotionally, passionate, enthusiastic, and a go-getter. I am a leader and often like to host gatherings and activities that encourage growth, support, and positive expansion. I like to share and be emotionally intimate with people I care for and am very willing to be vulnerable with those who want to relate in that way.

The prospect of moving in with a new roommate for the upcoming academic year fills me with excitement and anticipation. As an extrovert, I genuinely enjoy engaging in conversations and building meaningful relationships with others. I find great joy in getting to know people from diverse backgrounds and discovering the unique experiences and perspectives they bring to the table. So, rest assured, I'll be more than happy to strike up conversations and create a comfortable, friendly atmosphere in our shared living space.\nWhen it comes to my favorite activities, I have a couple of passions that bring me immense happiness. One of them is playing tennis. I find the sport to be not only physically invigorating but also mentally stimulating. The feeling of stepping onto the court, the satisfying sound of the racket hitting the ball, and the thrill of a well-executed shot make tennis a source of pure joy for me. Additionally, golf is another sport that I enjoy. There's something serene about being out on the green, surrounded by nature, and challenging myself to improve my swing and accuracy.\nIn my leisure time, you'll often find me engrossed in watching Chinese dramas. I have developed a deep appreciation for the captivating storytelling and rich cultural elements these dramas offer. They transport me to different worlds, allowing me to immerse myself in compelling narratives and explore the beauty of Chinese culture. If you're interested, I'd be more than happy to introduce you to some of my favorite series and share the excitement of discovering new stories together.\nBeyond my interests and hobbies, my overarching life goal revolves around maintaining a healthy and balanced well-being. I firmly believe that taking care of oneself is crucial for personal growth and happiness. Whether it's through regular exercise, mindful practices, or nourishing my mind with books and knowledge, I strive to prioritize my physical, mental, and emotional health. By doing so, I hope to cultivate a harmonious and fulfilling lifestyle that positively impacts those around me.\nI hope this extended description provides a clearer understanding of who I am as a person and what I value. I'm genuinely looking forward to embarking on this new living experience with you, creating lasting memories, and fostering a supportive and enjoyable living environment.",

        "negative_text": "When it comes to describing some of the less positive aspects of my personality or the feelings I experience, there are several aspects worth mentioning. Firstly, I have a tendency to engage in procrastination when it comes to completing my homework or tasks. Despite knowing the importance of timely action, I often find myself delaying the work, which can lead to increased stress and pressure as deadlines approach.\nAdditionally, I consider myself to be quite sensitive, and this sensitivity can manifest in various ways. For instance, I can feel uncomfortable or uneasy in environments that are dirty or excessively cold. These conditions have a significant impact on my mood and overall sense of well-being, often prompting me to seek cleanliness and warmth as a means of creating a more comfortable space for myself.\nMoreover, overthinking is another characteristic that I struggle with. I have a tendency to excessively analyze situations, events, and conversations, often dwelling on negative outcomes or potential problems. This habit of overthinking can be mentally exhausting and can hinder my ability to make decisions confidently, as I become entangled in a web of uncertainties and doubts.\nFurthermore, I find it challenging to let go of things, whether it's past mistakes, regrets, or possessions. This difficulty in letting go can create emotional baggage, preventing me from fully embracing the present moment and moving forward in a more positive and productive way. It takes considerable effort and self-reflection for me to release attachments and allow myself the freedom to grow and evolve.\nIn addition to that, I tend to exhibit perfectionistic tendencies. I have a strong desire for things to be in order and to meet high standards of excellence. This pursuit of perfection can be both a blessing and a curse, as it drives me to strive for excellence but also creates a constant feeling of dissatisfaction and restlessness. It can even affect my ability to relax and sleep when things are not in their desired place or state.\nLastly, impatience is another aspect of my personality that I wrestle with. When faced with delays, setbacks, or situations that don't align with my expectations, I can become easily frustrated and agitated. This impatience often stems from a deep desire for efficiency and progress, but it can sometimes hinder my ability to remain calm and composed in challenging circumstances.\nOverall, acknowledging and addressing these negative aspects of my personality and feelings is essential for personal growth and self-improvement. By recognizing these tendencies, I can work towards developing coping strategies and adopting a more balanced and positive approach to life's challenges."

I also greatly enjoy hanging out with friends and spending time with others; I hate being alone. I feel that I spend a lot more time focusing my energy on the external world (my goals, my friends, etc.) than myself. Most of my favorite activities involve other people, such as going out, playing games, watching movies, etc. I also enjoy music, both playing and listening. I probably spend at least half my day listening to music as I go about my day. I also find that I prefer hanging out and speaking to people 1 on 1 rather than in large groups. My most meaningful conversations and memories I have with friends are those we shared just the 2 of us. In larger groups I tend to hold back, as I am the type of person to let others speak and talk about themselves without being interrupted. ",

Is she better than me?\" I think this is closely tied with my competitiveness and insecurities about feeling lonely. I am also a moody person; the external world has a very strong influence on how I feel, which greatly reflects in the way I behave.

I would describe myself as open minded and I am always seeking to understand other people\u2019s perspectives and experiences. I don\u2019t like being judgemental and when I do judge I try to question what has led me to have those ideas engrained in my mind. I am a resilient person and although change tends to be scary I don\u2019t have a hard time adjusting to new situations or adopting new ideas. I tend to find myself disconnected from a lot of places, people and gatherings but now being in college I force myself to be open to new interactions even if I have a hard time starting conversations with new people. I am always down to make new connections and friends but I feel like my introvert personality often makes people think that I am not very approachable. I am curious and passionate about the things that catch my attention, not only academically but also in my personal life. I really enjoy reading and although most of the time I enjoy reading the texts that are assigned to me in class, I love it when I have the time to read novels, romance books, comedies, thrillers and mystery books. I also really like music. I am not an expert in any of these but I have some experience playing the guitar, the piano and the violin. I really love to sing too. I have been singing ever since I could remember and I have taken a few singing lessons. I enjoy most music genres but some of my favorites include soul, R&B, hiphop and mexican regional music. ",

Therefore, I have found out that if I want to avoid feeling of uneasiness I have to take a couple breaks in between activities. I also have a hard time making small talk and therefore quickly connecting with other people. I feel like I need to spend more time engaging in active conversations with someone before considering them friends. I am also very skeptical about a lot of things so I find myself doing research, learning about new topics, and trying to solve my inner doubts. This sometimes tends to consume a lot of my time which leads me to another negative aspect about myself which is the lack to skillfully manage my time. I have a hard time sticking to my schedule without getting myself distracted very easily. However, being a colllege student this is a skill I am constantly practicing and perfecting and there are a lot of resources, programs and organizations on campus that have helped me with this aspect.

I sometimes feel like I draw too much attention to myself, typically in my group of friends. For example, I catch myself talking about myself too much."

Another negative trait is sometimes when I am really tired I can be selfish and not want to do anything or help anyone with something, which makes me feel bad because I know I can help them. Also when I am sick a do become someone who likes attention and care because it makes me feel better to have somewhere there, which also isn't good because I know I can do a lot of stuff on my own. One annoying trait is I can be indecisive especially about food as I can't make designs and just want others to make them for me "

Although my own space is often messy, I feel guilty if I leave the communal space messy. I have a strong sense of right and wrong, I grew up Catholic, and although I don't consider myself Catholic anymore the guilt follows me everywhere. I am humble, but not very good at forgiving others that have wronged me even though I know it is bad to hang onto such things. I allow people to walk all over me because I want to be liked and I have a hard time accepting that people may not like me as much as I want them to. I'm kind to strangers even though I have a mean looking face. I overthink everything and make myself super anxious for no reason. I had to go on medication for it and now I make jokes about anxiety medication being my main personality trait. I feel like I have a lot of love to give but don't often accept love for myself. I feel unlovable a lot of the time and unworthy of affection. I don't like being touched by people I don't know and don't often touch people I don't know or even people I do now. I alienate myself in friendship settings and often self sabotage. I am a perfectionist and am very hard on myself and don't give myself a lot of grace. I have high expectations of myself but not others. I take better care of others than I do of myself. ",

        "text": "I like to say that I have a high self esteem and that is because when I was younger I got bullied and once I entered high school I decided to take care of myself and find things about my self and turned them into a positive way to look at myself. I am really caring, I use put others above my self but I really want the best for others and I care what other feels not about me but about their lives and situations around them. I usually don't like talking about my problems because I feel like I can create a burden to others. I really like the city, because I have lived in the desert my whole life I think the city is a different world and when I see tall building with lights at the top I feel like it is a place of hope and it gives me hope for the future. I love the colors purple and blue they usually make me feel really happy even though they are just colors. I have a passion of music, dance, baseball, and soccer, they ate very different but are very interconnected to me because they make me happy and I forget about everything around me that might be going bad. I am a hard worker I have always been a hard worker because I have seen and known what it is like to suffer and see what it is like to not have a privileged life. When I feel emotions I feel the strongly I'm not sure why maybe because I usually hide them and don't like seeing myself as weak by showing them. I like doing my makeup because I feel like I look pretty but I don't wear too much because I don't feel like myself. I like to dress casual and street wear because it is what makes me feel the most confident, I don't like dresses or heels its just not comfortable. I love reading books it takes me into a whole new world when I can let my imagination run wild.  I love shoes like converse, jordan's, nikes, vans and more  they also make me feel confident in myself. Sometimes I feel lonely and I have felt like this maybe my whole life because I'm the only child, I had no one to talk to or protect me like older sibling protect their younger siblings. ",

I usually talk a lot when the topic is either interesting, I have a strong opinion on it, or passionate about it. I usually think I have anger issues, I can get mad really easily and that is something that I am trying to work on and it annoys me that I can get so mad so easily. I can be really mean at times but its how I like to show my love for other, I am also usually sarcastic in a way and I think that is a bad habit to have because not everyone can react in a positive way. I also can get really distracted very easily and its frustrating because that leads to procrastination and that never goes well and I end up getting really stressed. "

You tell me to remember or do something within a certain amount of time, I am on it. Especially when it comes to helping out with chores, for I am a very tidy person. Each morning I make my bed, open the window, and clean my desk. I find cleanliness to be very important in establishing a conducive study environment.

Not in the aspect of muscle strong but it is so bold that you will be surprised on how hard it is to handle my personality. the reason why it will be hard is because I am a very honest person who doesn't hold back on my words. Mean or nice I will say it. I have no filter. Because of that I can be considered mean, rude, or even dumb. I say dumb because I can be inconsiderate and ask super random questions that sometimes can be seen as rude and insensitive, but honestly I am just curious and don't see the reason to hold back. however the good thing about me is that I am a very open person. I love to hear people put me in my place or tell me mistakes, I will most likely understand and hear where you are coming from. I do self reflect but sometimes I have to be called out in order for me to self reflect. I do hold grudges sometimes and get annoyed, but I get over myself very quickly so we won't be mad at each other for long periods of time. I mentioned before on how strong my personality is, I'm not mean, just that sometimes my words are portrayed as mean, but I will never say something mean to your face or purposely make you feel bad. Everyone does this but in the heat of the moment to my friends I might say something mean but its just to get it out of my system, but I will never purposely say something mean to hurt someones feelings in front of me. And I do care bout my image and values a lot so its very easily to make me feel bad because I value my image and values a lot. I never want to be portrayed as a mean girl so the moment I am called one, I will cry because that is not who I am or my intention. I am the type of person to learn from mistakes and learn. All I need is to be told sometimes. And I will sometimes talk back in a passive aggressive way but most of the type I won't say anything mean to your face. ",

I don't have very clear cut plans and like to go with the flow. I am pretty easy going and don't get upset a lot. I do have a lot of empathy and am told that I am a good listener. I love giving people advice. I like to watch movies and TV shows and get very passionate about them. They tend to be the center of a lot of my conversations and talking about them is how I open up to people. I like to talk to people about school and what they are doing. I like to read books, mainly sad and sappy romance books and thrillers, and dramas or thought provoking books. I am passionate about politics and spend a lot of my free time reading about that too. I love boba and always get the same place and same order until I find a new one to obsess over. I dont judge people a lot and try to see where everyone is coming from, even if I dont necessarily agree. I like to analyze people and the roots of their actions because it helps me empathize more. I appreciate a good laugh and I like to try to be funny. I have lots of inside jokes with the people I'm close to. I get random bursts of energy, I'm not really consistent which can be a good and bad thing. Im a procrastinator. I'm a extroverted introvert, I need to socialize with people but afterwards I need time to decompress. I am pretty intuitive. I often think with more feeling than logic, whcih can also be good and bad. However, I think I can help other people rationalize their problems, but I need help doing so with my own. I have a pretty idealistic view on things, I am pretty optimistic and hopeful for the best. I am also creative, i like finding new approaches to things, be it assignments or problem solving. I am not the neatest person all the time but I do clean up after myself. I like working in clean and organized spaces, even if they dont always reflect that. When I get overwhelmed my space also gets messy. I get overwhelmed quite a bit, and I can lash out in anger. However, I calm down quickly ",

Most dangerous of all is that covid still exists, which supports why I am extremely clean. It is not just the neatness of my desk and bunk bed but also practicing CDC guidelines. My favorite activities are gaming and working out. I plan on going to the RSF on the weekdays and was wondering whether you enjoy this as a hobby as well. This means I am also one who is persistent.

It is this eagerness to fully engage that has allowed me to excel in my work and school projects. My wife tells me that I am kind and sweet. I am certainly capable of these loving attributes but only with those I trust. I am innately a very compassionate soul who cares very much for the plight and security of others.

I am fairly particular about my mental rituals. For example, it is a terrible idea to try to talk to me about finances or other stressors right after I wake up and right before I go to bed. I consider this a protective mechanism for my anxiety and overall mental health but I confess that I can express myself with impatience, with sarcasm, and with disrespect to those who break my rules. I used to anger quite easily and respond quite impulsively. Age has mellowed those qualities of my personality but I can still harbor anger and resentments when I am not being mindful about my cognitive states. It is also true that that I try to deal with my negative emotions by myself. This means that I might seem off-color, or moody to others who are not privy to my thoughts."

I can be stubborn sometimes but can also be very understanding. I hate confrontational situations. I love going to do stuff with friends like shopping, a picnic, a movie. Anything that involves spending time with people and creating memories. I also love cheerleading, I love being in front of a crowd and cheering on people. Lifitng peoples spirits and dancing and doing what I love. I've been cheering for 9 years now. I can also be very sensitive, when it comes to being left out and not being incudlded all the time. I hate girls who don't invite you even if you cant go, an invite is still nice no matter what. Thats where my kindness comes in, I will always make sure everyone feels included and no one gets their feelings hurt. This often leads to be getting walked over though. People will take advantage of my kindness and I cant say no or confront them about it.",

One of the biggest influences on the formation of my personality was my youth pastor in high school who always stressed to us that it was important to be kind, caring, and loving to everyone you meet and to stay humble while you live your life. It's important to love and care for others as we all go through life together, and I believe this philosophy has shaped my personality to create someone who looks out for others, is attentive, and aware of others emotions. Another big part of my personality is music; I'm a bassist in the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra and music has really shaped my emotions and personality. Playing classical music has helped me to appreciate the beauty in many different art forms, and has also taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, cooperation, and the importance of being prepared. IN orchestra, everyone has to work as a unit, be it in their sections, instrument group, or as an orchestra as a whole. The self-discipline, perseverance, and passion required to play in an orchestra as good as the UCBSO has shaped me into someone who is a diligent hardworker, and willing to put the work into projects people care about.",

I tend to be the person that a lot of people talk to for advice, big or small. Even though I am shy at first and slow to warm, once I feel comfortable with someone and get along with them well, I definitely show more extroverted traits, such as talking a lot, sharing personal details of my life, etc. I am not judgmental as a person, but I am my own worst critic. I make it a point to not make the people in my life feel judged so they could come to me about anything that is concerning them. Nonetheless, I can be very honest and blunt and if I feel like I am in a place to tell you that what you are doing is not right, then I will say so. Growing up I was always a pretty optimistic child, but that has worn down with time and experiences. I still can be happy and optimistic, but I learned how important it is to consider the reality of things as well to keep myself grounded to avoid getting my own hopes up. I am always down to try something new, whether it be food, experiences, places, you name it! I always tell my friends, \"tell me a time and a place, and I will be there!\" I care a lot about the people in my life. My support system, family or friends, are very important to me and their opinion of me matters  A LOT. Nonetheless, I still treasure my alone time to recharge my social battery as I exhaust it very easily, especially to strangers/ new friends. ",

I can be very introspective, so sometimes I get caught up in an endless cycle of thinking terrible thoughts about myself, which leads to a negative outlook on life. I would like to preface, whenever I am in a negative headspace, it is only pertaining to me. I always have a lot of hope for other people, but it can be hard to give that same energy to myself. I also mentioned how I can be quite critical of myself and that is something I need to work on. I can be sensitive to people's opinion of me or being hard on myself to do better, whether it be in work or school. I can also have low energy levels at times, which does not necessarily make me the best company because I prefer to sit in silence during these periods. Regardless, I am conscientious of my moods and would never sign up to hang out with people when I am feeling down and not up for socializing. But yes, I am not always in the mood to interact with other people. It is hard to keep a conversation going with someone when you cannot turn off the conversations with yourself in your head."

I prefer organizations and tidiness but you can usually tell the state of my health and wellness through my messy desk and room/apartment. I struggle with communication but am working on dealing with things as they come up instead of waiting until it's too late to act reasonably and rationally. I can be oblivious especially if I'm preoccupied with my own world and thoughts. However, I'm working on being more mindful and present. I value my self-care and daily routines especially when it comes to working out, getting outside, and eating healthily as these things help keep me grounded. I like to think I'm funny but humor is subjective. I enjoy being playful and not taking things too seriously. I care about others and often spend time pondering issues my communities face. I would like to think people are good but sometimes we make crappy decisions. ",

I want to feel smart so I sometimes treat conversations like mental exercises or tests of my intelligence. I'm not dependable because I'm still working a lot of my issues. I don't follow through with things because my curiosity leads me to so many areas. Accordingly, my knowledge is broad but not necessarily specific or in-depth.

I am not afraid to sent confrontational messages on text which is important for me to express my opinions but this comes off as being snarky and a lot. \nI am interested in many things but don't feel like I am a master at anything in particular.

I am not as religious but I do believe in God. I am very organized and always try to clean my environment or space. I can study for long hours. I am comfortable going to new places with other people or by myself. I tend to be more of a leader than a follower. I was president of my high school class for 4 years and have facilitated many events. I like reaching out to new people and learning about their work and experiences. I like to reflect a lot and journal. I also like to run, so I am slightly physically active. I would say my tone gets louder the closer I am to a person. I like to joke around, so some might say I have a funny personality. I like to keep myself pretty busy with work and school. However, I manage my time pretty well. In doing so, I am able to allocate time to eat or spend time with friends. I love to babysit, dogsit, and catsit. I like following instructions as it is more clear in my head. However, I also enjoy problem-solving and thinking on my feet. I am an easygoing person and am adaptable to many different situations. I tend to keep any negative emotions to myself and resolve them through self-therapy or mindful meditation. I practice being kind and compassionate in this world. I also try to practice good sleep.

I enjoy cooking and watching sports, so I will spend a lot of time in my apartment doing those two things. I am very agreeable, so I tend not to get into many arguments. If I mess up doing something, I would like to be told that I have messed up so I can adjust my behavior, even if the mistake was minor or just causing a small annoyance. To accompany that agreeableness, I tend to stay out of the way of others as much as possible if I am not close to them. Once I get close to people I feel a bit more comfortable asking things of them, but before that familiarity is established I tend to keep to myself. I am very with small talk but don't try to force conversations to be longer than they have to be. If there is a shared interest, such as sports or travel, I like to talk with a person for as long as they like and find out more about them, but I try my best not to pry. I am not a party person and do not feel inclined to put myself in situations to meet a lot of new people all at once. I enjoy meeting new people in smaller settings when I am introduced by mutual friends or in similar situations, but I can get overwhelmed in large new environments. I am a good listener and like to hear about what people care about in their lives because even if I cannot relate I enjoy when people talk about what they are passionate about.",

        "text": "Due to the MBTI test, I am considered an ISTJ when it comes to personality. I am thoughtful and reflective, as I like to think things through and consider all the details before making decisions. I value structure in my daily life and think mostly logically over emotionally, so I often make to-do lists and schedules to keep everything on track. Having a solid routine also helps me stay focused and productive. I\u2019m also entirely responsible and dependable in any situation. You can count on me to follow through if I say I will do something, whether keeping my room clean or taking out the trash. I take my commitments seriously, whether related to schoolwork, household chores, or helping a friend. I appreciate others doing the same because it makes living together smoother and more predictable and shows that feelings or actions are reciprocated.When it comes to my feelings, I tend to keep them to myself until I\u2019m comfortable with someone. I\u2019m not the type to wear my heart on my sleeve, but I\u2019m a good listener and always ready to lend a supportive ear. Once I feel more at ease, you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m warm and caring and I genuinely value close, meaningful relationships. As for my favorite activities, I enjoy things that require concentration and attention to detail. Video games are a big hobby of mine, mainly FIFA and Valorant. I also like puzzles, strategy games, and anything that challenges my mind. It is relaxing to unwind with a good game at the end of the day. As an introvert, I enjoy spending time alone to recharge. However, I appreciate quality time with friends, especially when it involves interesting conversations or shared activities. I look forward to meeting you!",

I can regulate my emotions pretty well, so a lot of the time my feelings or reactions to things are pretty mild (with the exception of getting excited, cause i can get VERY hyper and excited about things). On the whole I am a pretty positive person, and when I have thoughts or feelings in my mind I don't like, I just put them in a box and move on with my day. My favorite activities are hanging out with friends, eating food, annoying my cat, napping, and rewatching netflix shows. I am terrible at gift giving and value acts of service or quality time more. A thoughtful note is better than a present in my opinion.

I'm also terrible at maintaining friendships and reaching out to people when we're no longer forced to see each other every day (ie friends from high school). I can be shy and not express what I'm really thinking. I would rather go along with what the majority of the group thinks than be on my own with my opinions.

However I think I am intuitive and in touch with how other people feel. My emotions can change very suddenly and rapidly, and I experience them in extreme ways. I can be both very happy and very sad in the span of 24 hours. I am average in terms of neatness, but I like collecting things that interest me. I am artistic and enjoy things that appear pretty to me. I want to surround myself with pretty things, but people I can be genuine and real with. I can get frustrated very easily if I don\u2019t understand something or it isn\u2019t working out. My patience can be thin if it\u2019s something that I think isn\u2019t worth waiting for. I easily feel guilty and like I\u2019m burdening other people when I ask for help, so I prefer to be independent. I can be stubborn in terms of seeing eye to eye with people that don\u2019t have values that align with my own. I can be picky with who I choose to spend my time with, and I hate time that is wasted. Sometimes I feel like people don\u2019t take me seriously and I guess I can be a pushover depending on the person I\u2019m interacting with. I think my sense of justice is stronger than most people\u2019s, but I\u2019m not that interested in group activism or charity work. I think my focus is more on the individual and myself, which I suppose sounds a bit narcissistic. But I have low self esteem regarding my personality and physical appearance, and I don\u2019t value myself as much as maybe the average person. I only go to big parties a handful of times a year, mostly out of social obligation rather than personal enjoyment. I prefer interacting with people one on one over something pleasant like food or coffee. ",

I can also have deep conversations with someone or really put my thinking skills to the test when it comes to certain topics. I definitely am an overthinker so I can spend a long time making a choice or doing a certain task. Also, I am someone who is hard on myself and so I can easily become disappointed. Another random thing about me is that I don't like physical activity nor conflict. Nevertheless, I would say I am a good person to have as a roommate because though I will always be supportive of people who are close to me and can have fun with them, I also require a lot of alone time to rest and am an independent person so I feel like I would also like someone who is a combination of both.

I am always striving to be kind and to listen fully; I am very interested in making sure I'm paying attention to the needs of others and communicating my needs clearly, as well as helping others communicate their needs clearly. I think most people's perspectives can be understood if we just listen long enough and are genuinely paying attention fully enough to earn someone's trust, and I also believe strongly that people are doing their very best almost all of the time. I believe most people are genuinely interesting, and that if we don't know that about them, we just haven't earned their trust enough or chosen to care about what they care about enough. I believe we all have dignity and try to behave as such, but I also do things like get frustrated about people standing up in front of me at a sit-down concert if I haven't dealt with my anger related to other situations first. I try to be self-aware and get better as much as possible, usually in my treatment of others, and also in my levels of self-mastery and kindness to myself. I preach self-care and don't always follow my own advice, but I try to. I am really intellectually curious and find most things quite interesting. I can overcommit out of an excitement for new experiences or knowledge or interactions, but I also really value quiet time with lower amounts of stimulus either by myself or with a trusted loved one. I am tall and that has influenced my personality in ways I am continuing to understand.\n\nAlso I've had this page open on my computer for over three hours and was on an airplane, so I don't think this will let me submit until the time elapses; this is unfortunate as I completed this page in time and just didn't have wifi onboard.

This isn't common now, but it was when I was a kid and took some learning about how to process and control my frustrations (usually felt at perceived or real injustices). I also get anxious, largely informed by my experiences of trauma earlier in life related to loved ones experiencing multiple major illnesses and or early, untimely, or unexpected death. Plus, I got bullied a lot in middle school, which didn't help my confidence and has been a wound I've been working to heal for quite some time. I also struggle financially more often than not, as do my parents, which makes everything harder. I do my best to cope with these experiences, understand and manage my emotional responses better each time I experience them, communicate well, and process my feelings in a healthy way (again, usually through communication)."

Music is one of the most significant things to me as I listen to hours of it per day. I used to do a lot of painting and traditional art but unfortunately don't have the time for it anymore, or at least that's what I tell myself. I am a very clean person and try to keep my room as tidy as possible, but if you're a little messy I most likely won't confront you.

I am very detail oriented and clean in my space. I am aware of where all my things are and am very particular that they be kep tin a certain way. I am a little type a in this way. I am also very positive. Things don't often get me down and I see the silver linings in most situations or can make humor out of it. But if I am ever down, I get REALLY down. I am a very introspective person, I like to really think abnout things - sometimes too much to the point of overthinking. I also like to journal to help me navigate my thoughts and feelings. Journalling is another thing I do when I want to spend time by mself or are feeling out of sorts. I like to read, go on long walks, walk through new areas, shop or explore new small shops near me, try new food places, and be active. GOing off walks, I like to go on hikes, ride bikes, or anything active. I don't watch a lot of TV, but if I did I like to watch funny shows like New Girl or The Office. I like to watch movies but only if the weather is bad. If the weather is nice I like to spend time outside. I love just sitting in the sun. I also love going to the beach. I love being productive and if I'm not always doing something I get restless and upset at myself. I like to do lots of silly little tasks that make me feel productive but larger, lengthy projects actually scare me. I get discouraged from trying new things if I am not immediately good at them. I get embarassed easily in front of others. I hate dancing or singing in front of people because I'm not good at it. I don't like doing things I'm not good at. But I persist at things I am already good at. I like to make people laugh and make people smile. I love doing things for other people. I like when people look up to. I work hard so others will look up to me. I love to be kind to others and make a lot of decisions with other people in mind. I don't like to do things if I know they will upset or embarass other people. I sometimes worry I am too selfish. ",

        "text": "I think the best way to describe myself is to think about how my friends would describe me. In general, I'm known to be quite determined, genuine, honest, and empathetic. I'm a loyal friend and apparently a good listener/advice-giver. I am reliable, as some of my friends this summer have said I give off \"big sister energy,\" which likely comes from the fact that I am responsible with myself, with the people I choose to spend time with, and anticipate the needs of others which makes it seems like I always know what to do or what to say. \n\nI think there are different scenarios when you first meet me. Sometimes I can come off as quite reserved and private, and other times I'm the first one to strike the conversation. I like to protect my time and have self care days, but also enjoy spontaneously hanging out with friends or making plans to do some sort of activity in advance. I'd say I'm a pretty balanced and predictable person based on the way I treat my friends and family. \n\nI am hardworking. I take my academics and career goals quite seriously, but have gotten a lot better at not giving myself too much pressure. I've learned to trust myself with the years of experiences I've had to learn my strengths and weaknesses. As such, I feel like I am also always looking out for the the best interests of others when making decisions or handling conflict. I'd say I used to have a lot of discipline in things regarding my goals, health, and wellbeing, but I've been less strict and punitive about it in the past year.\n\nIn terms of things I like to do, I like being active. I try to exercise whenever I have the energy, play volleyball whenever I'm free, and try to go on little hikes or walks with my friends. I think my friends are a core factor in what I choose to do or spend my time; company matters a lot to me, especially when I'm trying or experiencing something new. \n\nI think that I'm a more optimistic person now. Most days I am relatively happy, and try not to let negative emotions influence how I interact with others. I do get into slumps sometimes, but I always look forward to when those days are over.",

        "negative_text": "I think a big part that I left out in my introduction is my anxiety. I've never been clinically diagnosed, but my closest friends and family members know that I am a very anxious person. I don't think it affects me as much now, but definitely did a lot of my childhood and teenage years. Either I've gotten better at dealing with it, or its been repressed (which I will have to admit does come out sometimes during stressful times like exams or job recruiting).\n\nI also think I can be unapproachable at times. Upon meeting someone for the first time, or being in a new situation where I potentially feel insecure or don't trust a person, I can come off as quiet and standoff-ish. It's much harder for me to open up in those situations, and likely people won't think I'm relatable or necessarily fun and easy to talk to. My mom used to describe me as a porcupine, where, if you get to close or if I feel threatened, my quills will spike out. \n\nOn the same vein, I can seem very nonchalant to people who are not as close to me. I'm less willing to drop what I'm doing to help that person unless I truly mean it. Some people can't take this brute honesty and I try to distance myself in an appropriate way so that it doesn't become offensive."

Another key feature of my perosnality is that I am very passionate and committed to new things that I try. When I start new projects I try to commit until the very end and make sure I succeed at it. I am very outgoing overall my favorite activities to do are to go to the gym, be outside, watch sports and hang out with my friends. I like to be outside a lot because I enjoy being in nature and away from technology and just take a break every once in a while. Although I am very outgoing if someone does not want to join me or wants to do something else then I am always open to that and will not force them into doing what I want to do. In my free time I enjoy listening to music and playing video games I like that both of these activities give me a chance to hangout and just de-stress. The sports I enjoy watching the most are basketball, soccer, football and formula one.",

It's made some relationships a little more work on my end, and on occasion, it'll interfere minorly with my sleep. I am also very empathetic and work really hard to be; I think that many of my interests revolve around this tendency and this conscious effort, whether that be interest in political work, social issues, group dynamics, and the like.",

I'm anxious and awkward around new people and situations but I get over that quick once I get used to both. After that, I do exhibit better qualities like being a great listener and someone who always wants to help in any way they can. I even show some extraversion when we compete in a sport or videogame. My favorite activities is kind of just to discuss and share the music, movies, and other entertainment to other people because I was \"raised\" by the Internet like most of my generation. I feel proud of my taste in these things because I know what I like and why I like it. Besides that, I do enjoy nature, cooking, and walking around. Some negative qualities so I can be transparent are that I either get depressed or hostile when something doesn't go my way and I struggle to handle or get out of the mindset, but to counteract this, I try my best to show support to my friends and family whenever they happen to be in that situation and that somewhat helps me realize what I can do for myself next time.",

Things like videogames do frustrate me and when I'm playing something with others I regret that I do blame them or treat them with passive aggression when something wrong happens. I would also say my anxiety prevents me from making a lot of new friends. I know what the right thing to do is but I just experience a mental block when I approach a group of new people in a new situation. That's about all I can think of right now but I'm sure there's more that I haven't mentioned."

At the end of the day, we each have our own unique qualities and traits that makeup who we are. When it comes to describing my own personality, I would say that I have more positive characteristics than negative ones. I am a very outgoing individual who loves to get involved in different conversations and activities. I am always open to learning about new topics and engaging in new adventures to expand my knowledge and expand the variety of experiences I have gone through. I would like to say that I am an extrovert who can engage in conversations with whoever I come across and I am someone who enjoys engaging in these conversations because it allows me to connect with new people and understand them in different ways. I can crack a funny joke or make a compliment when I meet someone new in order to create an atmosphere of comfortableness and openness between me and the other individual. I am also someone who truly enjoys being out of my comfort zone. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California and I have lived a pretty comfortable life for the past eighteen years. As soon as I turned nineteen, I knew it was time to start being more independent and moving on with my life. Leaving my family, my job, my friends, and my life back home was very hard to do, but I am glad to be out of my comfort zone and trying new things every day. Meeting a new individual and becoming roommates with them is something that I have truly enjoyed so far. You have no idea who these people are and they have no idea who you are, it is the ability to get a fresh start and be the person you have always wanted to be. Currently, I live with three other roommates and I am confident to say that we have built a very special and strong connection so far. We took the time to get to know each other and we all shared our backgrounds in order to understand each other much better. My roommates have been able to view my personality as someone who is interesting, caring, loyal, open, and as someone who has the ability to engage and create deep conversations that could last hours. Just last night, we had an intense conversation until three in the morning speaking about our lives and what we want to do in the future. I got to introduce them to my friends back home via FaceTime and it was a very wonderful experience, and definitely a core memory. I also got to introduce them to my favorite sports, such as water polo and swimming. I am also a lifeguard, and I brought a rescue tube from my job back home to put in my dorm. My roommates were confused and asking about what it was, so it was very fun to explain to them what it is used for and my experience as a lifeguard. ",

They are not necessarily bad people, since every individual has a few negative traits which make us who we are. A few negative traits that I had left out in my previous response is that I am a very heavy overthinker. I tend to overthink the smallest things which cause me to ruin my entire day just by thinking about something small or having no importance at all. This is a negative characteristic I have because when I am overthinking something, my entire mood and attitude begin to change since it is the only thought I am having in my brain. It is very hard to overcome this sort of negative behavior, but it also allows me to understand that it is a human emotion that I can deal with and it allows me to be conscious about what is going on and why I am overthinking a certain topic. Instead of feeling bad about myself for it, I like to take it as a learning experience and I allow myself to grow and understand the situation from a better and different perspective. I like to talk it out with a close friend and explain my emotions to them, get their feedback, and reflect if the situation is truly concerning to the point where I have to continue stressing or thinking about it for multiple hours or days.

I do have issues of lethargy and depression which can cause me to be reclusive and stay in my room and to myself some of the time. I may not always be smiles and laughter but that doesn't mean I am mad or upset, just really low energy. I love coffee and subsist on that to get through the day. I enjoy creative outlets like drawing and puzzles. I am not the most technologically savvy person and have been known to be late at responding to texts and other social media outlets. I am going through the process of self-improvement and self-care so I've been watching what I eat and trying to build better habits such as exercise, sleep, and clean eating but I have not been too consistent with that. Because of my journey on self-improvement, I have been using a lot of my free time scouring the web for more information on advice and the scientific backing behind the recommended methods of improvement",

Because of this, I have a tendency to be a little harsh in my tone and responses if you try to strike up a conversation first thing in the morning. I have a hard time being empathetic and caring when I am not fully awake, I am pretty lazy and my room is quite messy. I vacuum once a week or maybe in two weeks. I know that can bother some people.

I could definitely be healthier in that aspect. I think I can have a little bit of an ego at times, particularly when it comes to physical appearance. I think I am a pretty attractive person and it can definitely cross over into the vain area. This one is a lot harder to write about. I also think I am not good at confrontation. If someone does something or says something that bothers me, I'll most likely never bring it up. I'm still learning how and when to stand up for myself.

        "text": " Over recent years I have found that I have changed dramatically from who I used to be. In grade school I was always very shy, had many friends but kept to myself for the most part, I did not like being the center of attention as it made me socially anxious. Fast forward to present day I am more socially anxious than ever (I had to start going to therapy which was a huge step for me) but despite this I have found that I don't let my anxiety stop me from achieving goals of mine, which requires a lot of social engagement. Although I can be friendly to others I find that my anxiety makes me come across as rude sometimes. For example, when I am in a large setting and there are many unfamiliar faces I don't engage as much as I should with these people I am surrounded with. I am very fond of classic rock music, it can be very loud and obnoxious but it surprisingly calms my anxiety. Most people my age aren't familiar with the bands and artists I listen to, therefore I have been told that I am different than most people, some people find my taste in music unique while others find it peculiar. Another activity that calms my anxiety, besides music, is painting. I enjoy using acrylic paint on my free time. Most of the time I don't think about what I am going to paint, I just let my hands do its thing. These are just a few things that I like to do, but who am I? How am I with other people? How do people perceive me? Well based on interactions with friends and family I am told that I can be very conscientious. I think my anxiety has made me this way. Furthermore I can also be very impulsive in the sense that something that crosses my mind, like stopping what I am doing and running to a tattoo shop to get my inner lip tattooed (this is a true story). Some people may find my impulsiveness reckless, but I think I just like adventures and living life in the present. ",

In addition to this, I am very blunt and the tone of my voice is very serious so when I am speaking truthfully to someone I can sometimes hurt their feelings (even though it is never my intention to deliberately hurt someone). I can also be a smart aleck, although I am trying to work on this. "

My bedtime is usually well past midnight, despite the fact that I am wide awake by 7am regardless of when I went to sleep and I am awake in an instant without a need for coffee or a shower to get me energised. Despite this, I am a very calm person. I take situations as they come and am generally great in a crisis (which I know from experience). This doesn't mean that I do not worry about all the little things - be it whether my sister is doing ok in the room next door, whether I have fed the dog this morning, or if my dad is enjoying his day/night back home in Germany. I laugh easily, come to conclusions readily (although I often come to the opposite conclusion some while later, and may even switch back once more). I find it pretty hard to feel negative feelings and am extremely pragmatic in my approach to anything unpleasant I may be experiencing. Many people close to me may be annoyed by as I am someone who expresses empathy by trying to help you come up with a solution. I am not the person to come to vent to and have sit with you in your feelings. I am obsessed with tennis, and have been since I was 6. I have been an equestrian my entire life as well and have head my head stuck in books since before I could read myself. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and my happiest place is any sort of beach - be it pond, lake, or ocean. I compulsively buy flowers anytime I am at a grocery store or pass a flower stand on the way home because it makes me happy and I don't think there is a point in waiting for someone else to buy them for me when I can pick exactly what I want myself. That doesn't mean I won't be extremely touched and elated if someone else were to buy me flowers. ",

It is a byproduct of my upbringing (lived in 7 countries in 17 years) that when someone is gone, I do not feel sad that they are away. I find myself judging people who need time to wallow and feel bad for themselves when something upsets the instead of trying to find a way to fix things. I am an older sister who raised my younger sister and kept us alive in a household of divorce of a narcissist while living in a foreign country so I think I can do everything better than everyone else (hero-child syndrome). I feel actual anger when my dad or sister try to wash dishes, clean, or cook and they do it differently from how I would. I am unable to accept help because I have had to do everything myself for a long time. I don't let myself feel general sadness (I genuinely don't cry), and instead I turn to silent internalised rage that just expresses itself in harsh, rude comments that I have actively picked to hurt my \"opponents\" feelings."

I do not like to restrict myself and let myself do less than I am capable of doing. I can get frustrated quickly when something that I was in control of goes wrong. Overall, I am a very sociable and outgoing person, eager to show my leadership in different ways that I can. ",

I like to go on walks and listen to songs, I also play the guitar a bit. I write for fun. I don't stay up too late, or get up too early. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping. I would rather have a few close friends than many acquaintances. Friends and family that know me say I am kind, and sometimes too much so to the wrong people. I find myself agreeable, open, honest, and disciplined. While I am introverted, I still try to be friendly to everyone I encounter. I am very loyal to the people I love. I would prefer a roommate who is also clean, because it does bug me to live in a messy space. Still, I would describe myself as a flexible and open-minded person, and I think I could live with most people. I like to travel. I love to cook and bake, especially for the people that I love. Although I can be extremely patient with people, I do lose patience with creative projects easily. I do love to read, and I always have a book to read throughout the week. I love to drive. I think my favorite place to go is the beach. I like to swim. I think this for the most part describes a good deal of my personality traits, feelings, and favorite activities. ",

I am not as honest about my emotions, and I hide a lot of feelings or push it away. I care too much about what other people think. I get peer pressured. I match other people's personalities too much or try hard to make sure they like me. I am not super confident, but I am learning. I don't like a lot of people but I am still very nice to them if I see them, I think that's fake but I don't know how to cut people off or be blatantly rude. I am a pushover sometimes.

        "text": "I'd say my personality is quite vivacious. I am a person who is very easily-excitable and has an over-the-top reaction to many things. This coincides with the fact that I'd say Im pretty opinionated. Once I am comfortable with a person I have a hard time shutting my mouth, even when I probably should, and people will always know what is on my mind, but again, this is only if I am comfortable with the person and know them well. I'd say my outspokenness also makes me a very anxious person with people I do not know well. I know I have a hard time shutting my mouth once im open with a person, so I am extremely cautious with who and what I open up about at first. I have a really hard time introducing myself and making new friends, but if someone does decide to speak to me and try to crack my shell I give in really easily. I love to talk, I just hate the judgement that comes with it- if that makes sense. Over time I have kind of grown to hate how much I speak as often I will walk away from a conversation hating every word I ever spoke and it will indeed haunt me for the rest of my week. I think my own hatred for my voice ties in with why I am so enthusiastic and almost theatrical when I talk. Since I understand how traumatizing speaking can be I always try my best to be very open and receptive of others peoples words so they hopefully walk away with no regrets and are happy that they chose to open up to me. Some other aspects of my personality could be that I am very clumsy and forgetful. I often trip over things, bump into tables, accidentally knock over objects, you get the jist. My forgetfulness is not much better, for example today I had to drive back to the Bay Area from Chico and though I thought I packed everything, 5 minutes into my car ride I got a call from my boyfriend saying I forgot my laptop which was probably the most important thing for me to have remembered. Im not sure if being a bit of a mental mess is considered a personality trait, but it is an aspect of myself that people close to me seem to really notice and look out for now. Some other notable things about my personality could also be that I've been told I have a quick-wit. I am very fast to make a joke or comment back at people and love to word my sentences in odd ways. I think this is because my brain works at 600mph and connections come to me very quickly once I am spoken to, again this all ties back to thinking I am a vivacious person because there is never a lack of words or reactions when one is speaking to me. I may never spark the conversation, but I am also never the one to end it either. ",

        "negative_text": "Oh boy where do I start. As I touched on in the last question, I never shut up, and I am also very anxious. These two are ingredients for a lovely self-hating cocktail because though I would like to talk and walk away from the interaction happy, I tend to walk away wanting to bury myself in a hole and never come out. This is frustrating for the people I am closest to because they have to deal with me constantly looking at myself in a pessimistic way, and obviously, that is not very healthy. I pity my boyfriend because no mater how hard I try to restrict myself from telling him my negative thoughts, I simply can't help but unleash my load of bad news and thoughts to him. I fear often that this makes me draining to be around, he says he loves to hear me talk, even about the bad stuff, but my self doubt can't help but tell me this i snot true. I also feel bad for my best-friend at times because if I ever speak to her about my negative thoughts (whether it be about me appearance or personality) I fear that she may start looking at herself in a negative way, or searching for what my flaws are within her self. I know comparison is something that comes naturally to women so I never want my words to impose on how she views herself but I also know that cant be helped. Finally, this brings me to the point where I believe my own self-hatred can make me judgemental of others which is also something I am greatly ashamed of. Since I am so hyper-aware of my flaws sometimes I will meet other people and search to see if they too have these flaws. I absolutely hate this about myself and try my very best to train my brain to not think that way, but sometimes I slip up and catch my thoughts being extremely bitchy and I wish I could just love myself more so I can see more of the best in other people and improve my relationship with those I love the most. I guess this can all be summed up to my self-esteem is shit and it makes me unhealthy to be around at times. "

I constantly need to remind myself that the world does not revolve around me. Lastly, I have borderline ADHD and it gets triggered when I am with a lot of people especially people I love and care about and have not seen in a long time.

That being said, I also really love and value being alone. I would say I am a mix between an extrovert and an introvert. When I first meet a person, I tend to be a little bit shy but as I start to get to know someone, I definitely get more comfortable and become more extroverted. I really enjoy comedy and making jokes. I find that watching funny movies, funny shows or funny videos is my favorite thing to do. I tend to be a little unserious and I try to laugh in moments when life gets difficult. I love having deep conversations with people and find that whenever I am in a group setting, I tend to gravitate more toward one person and speak with them rather than speaking to the whole group. I love listening to music and it is such a huge part of my life because about 80% of my day is spent listening to music. My music taste is very diverse and I wouldn't say I have a set genre that I listen to. I listen to just about anything because I always tend to find a song from every genre that I enjoy listening to.

I'm generally a very hardworking person, but I have spurts of motivation or slumps that make it hard to stay consistent. I'm also a very calm person and don't get emotional very often. If I do, I get overwhelmed and tend to shut down, so it helps to let it out from time to time! In terms of favorite activities, I love to dance and be creative. In my free time, I am usually going to dance practices, volunteering, or working on another DIY project. My love language is food, so I will usually be cooking and baking for my friends and trying out new restaurants with them. I like hanging out with friends and doing spontaneous trips, but I love to travel and aspire to go on more international trips once the pandemic is over. In terms of getting to know new people and making friends, I tend to get along with people who have similar values and political views. My friends are very diverse in terms of hobbies, personalities, and styles, but I make friends with people who have a similar energy as me (more on the chill, relaxed side) and generally align with my values (work ethic, open mind, etc.).

I can be manipulative, I don't think it's hard to get people to agree with my idea by making them believe it was their idea. In the past, it was easy to manipulate a situation to try and get my friends to just skip the drama and see the right choice in a situation (ie: yes break up with your boyfriend, who clearly doesn't love you, instead of prolonging it and making your life more miserable). but I don't do it much anymore because it made me feel like I was playing \"God\" when people need to learn on their own. I have anger issues and repress my emotions a lot, this won't really create any problems as I am good at not having outbursts, but it does affect things like my level of patience. When I overthink or stress, it can honestly cause a little existential crisis where I feel the need to plan out my life for the next 10 years (which obviously isn't possible but I try anyways). I'll believe I'm good for nothing and have barely made it far for some weird, obscure reason instead of seeing that I did work hard and continue to work hard for my goals. "

I feel best when I get to be helpful and bring some joy to someone during the day, whether that be for a stranger, the kids that I work with, or my friends/family. I can be a bit spacey, disorganized, and easily distracted, especially when I am having a burst of energy or have too much on my plate. Even though my life can feel a little chaotic, I still manage to take strides towards my educational and personal goals. When I have free time between work and class, I listen to music, go on runs, play music and go to a coffee shops. Most of the time, I feel confident and secure in my abilities, my self, and the path that I am on. I tend to have an optimism in life that things are happening for a reason and I am where I need to be.",

If I were being honest, I believe all of those things that I wrote to be true and I am in a good mood as I am writing, so it doesn't feel like a facade. That being said, I didn't talk about the fact that I had to work through multiple addictions and join a twelve step program in order to get to the place that I am now. While I no longer am in active addiction, I still have selfish thoughts, impulsive tendencies, and black and white thinking. I can become dependent on people or things to supply me with self worth if I slack on doing the self care in my life in order to feel happily and usefully whole. In those moments when I stop doing the right things in my life, I begin feeling anxious and overwhelmed by people and my responsibilities."

        "text": "I would describe my personality as a bubbly, friendly, considerate, empathetic, generous type of person. I think I would say I am bubbly because I smile and laugh very easily. It does not take much to make me smile whether it is a small joke someone says or says something that makes my day. I think this is a good trait that I have because a little smile can make someone else's day and I can also say that I am content with my life. The words I used to describe myself a lot is being generous and considerate. I know that everyone has a story behind them and that there are always going to be struggles in their lives. Even if I may not have a similar problem as the person surrounding me, I would try to help them, give advice, try to distract them from the issue going on in their life, or just try to comfort them in a way that would help them. I would also say that I am easygoing because even if I have a routine in my daily life, I am not strict with it. I am pretty flexible with it so I am always willing to try new things and meeting new people which has been a big trait that has been nice to have while coming to Berkeley. Other words to describe me is very hardworking. I try to do the best on everything I do because sometimes we only have one shot to complete it or fulfill it. I do not want to put in minimum effort and do poorly as I set expectations for myself. I want my parents to be proud of all the work I do and I also want to be proud of my work so I would put in as much effort as I can give myself to complete a task. I try to motivate myself and find ways to become productive, but since I am a human with many mistakes and flaws, there are obviously some days where I am not as motivated as some days which I came to the conclusion that it is okay to take breaks.",

It may not sound like a bad trait to have but it has come to many examples where I am being taken advantage of from many companions. I am also the type to be very sensitive. I do not take criticism very easily which I want to be able to, but my emotions get in the way. I blame myself and start thinking that I could have done better depending on the scenario. I sometimes cross boundaries where I feel like I am close to someone and start telling them about things that are unnecessary which has come to make me feel like it can be in a negative aspect in my life. I also tend to think I am worse at things than I am which makes me feel not confident in a lot of things such as when speaking in class. I sometimes would know the answer but I would be too scared to say it due to me not being confident and being scared of judgement. Although these may not seem to be super terrible traits, I have been in many scenarios where some parts of my personality can become negative in some aspects or even positive in some parts as well. "

I can be blunt and direct if needed, but I usually tend to avoid conflict and strive to have a peaceful living space.  I can be emotional and very self-reflective, but I keep this all to myself unless if I become friends with my roommate.

        "text": "Hey roomie!! Can't wait to room with you this year!! I would like to describe myself as a somewhat proactive and organized  person (although I do tend to procrastinate sometimes and go on spontaneous shopping sprees or coffee adventures. I am a huge relationship-oriented person, and I think that going through college really taught me that people will always be more important than your GPA. I grew up to be achievement-oriented, whether that be receiving top grades or doing phenomenal things in my extracurriculars as a leader. While college has definitely made me aware to the amount of super excelling people (definitely has humbled me), I still try to do my best to achieve and excel, while maintaining balance with my mental health and well-being. I am empathetic, open, and strive to be impartial; something that I despise the most is when people hear one side of the story and see that as truth. I realize that we all our entitled to our own opinions, biases, and other values, as we all grew up with different backgrounds. However, I believe that always being open to shift our lenses and perspectives to whatever issue that rises is super important in understanding each other and being kind, respectful people. I love my family, and I have pride of being an older sister. :) \n\nI have a TON of hobbies --- music being my primary one. I grew up with music for the past 15 years of my life as a classical pianist, flute section leader, and the first female junior drum major of my high school. I have a soft spot for anyone who loves music, or wants to learn music. Like my relationship with music, I believe that it's important that every person has an emotional outlet. While I consider myself extroverted, I also value my introspective/introverted times when I am by myself, as I feel like it's relaxing and it helps me calm down in a situation with a lot of noise, stress, and intensity. It is at these times I play piano.\nI love watching anime, Korean dramas, and TV shows --- it's the second hobby that I spend most of my time on. Watching shows on my own is fun, but watching shows with my best friends while munching on my favorite snacks (Sweetheart french fries YES) is the best. \nI love hanging out with my friends, and a lot of these hangouts consist of some kind of food exploration (usually an aesthetic place or Korean soon tofu), and adventuring new places. My boyfriend is my main support system, and we do everything together. \nWOw this was so disorganized my thoughts are all over the place LOL  ",

I think that accepting criticism and the traits that are not as positive has been an ongoing journey with myself, and that's completely healthy. I used to think that I am open and extroverted with basically anyone, but I actually find myself being exclusive with the people that I hang out with or talk to sometimes. Even though I tell myself and believe that everyone deserves a chance to be friends, I also go against that by being hesitant or even resistant in talking/hanging with particular people I don't know. (My boyfriend, on the other hand, thinks with the mentality of \"the more people the merrier,\" which made my thoughts clearer.) I sometimes have a hard time sticking up for myself or what I want because of my people-pleaser mentality. I believe I improved, but I think that I can do better. \nI can be a little selfish --- for example, when I know that my boyfriend is tired, I still let him do the dishes for me anyway. It's a small, silly story, but that's the first example that popped up in my head. "

Whether that be in medicine, public health, helping people out, singing, music, exercising, food, or with family and friends, I will always stay focused on my goals so I can be the best version of myself possible.\n\n2) Caring. Not only am I a huge people person, but I would not hesitate to take a bullet for some of my closest friends and my family. I love the people around me and would sometimes put them over myself when times get tough for them, or even if they just need someone to talk to. It warms my heart to be able to make someone's day, and it keeps me going, even if I am feeling down myself. \n\n3) Weird. Whether it be my sense of humor, the way I dress (sometimes), or the lingo that I use, I am NOT someone that follows any sort of rules to fit in. I take pride in being WAY too comfortable at certain times--it's pretty clear that one should not burp in a room of silence, and imma do it again BAP BAP. Warning: don't worry, I am aware that there are extenuating circumstances when I should NOT do this, including professional environments, family dinners, and Psych 150. Everything else is fair game tho.",

Although it is great to be caring about many people, it hurts sometimes because I may think someone is a close friend, but nothing's reciprocated. When someone is hurt, I get hurt too, and the more people I tend to care for, the more susceptible I am to being sad because of the downs that my friends and family go through.\n\n2. Too comfortable. Remember when I said I am too comfortable with some of the stuff I do? Sometimes, it backlashes. I have had multiple people say that they were uncomfortable with the person I am due to my sense of humor or some of the rash remarks I make at times. I never mean anything ill-intentioned, however, sometimes it may be perceived as such, and its costed me greatly before.\n\n3. I do not like being by myself. It is something that I am still learning to be comfortable with. Otherwise, I would always try to surround myself with people. Obviously, one should love themselves the most, but when it comes to me, I would much MUCH rather be with my friends and family rather than be alone."

I try to avoid conflict as much as possible with people because I don't like the feeling of causing drama. I can also be a very emotional person at times. I get also very anxious when I feel things are not going my way. Besides all of these emotions I am also very fun, I like to party, go out with my friends, and on a Friday night have a nice cocktail. I am always up for a new adventure if I have the time. I don't like making people feel out of place because I know the feeling and its not cool. I also like my alone time, there is a time during the day where I just want to be alone and not socialize with anyone, especially when it comes to doing homework or little things like walking to class. I enjoy listening to music when i walk to class and if someone is talking to be it takes away from my moments of peace. ",

I like to be as minimalist as possible and having to many things really freaks me out. I also don't like it when people use my things or touch them or even move them.

I also know I have a tendency to take on other people's emotional labor, but have been working on taking on less (empathy's double edge-sword). I enjoy learning about mindfulness and grounding techniques, which I use to help me when I am stressed. I tend to be prepared for the worst case scenario. I also believe in the best in people.

I feel that I make more of an effort to ask questions and keep the conversation going when I am with someone who is more introverted than I am, but I do less talking and make less of an effort to keep the conversation going when I am with someone who is more extraverted than me. I am definitely more introverted though, as I definitely run out of social battery at social events and big gatherings, and I feel more comfortable and at peace in my room. I would definitely prefer staying home doing my own thing than going out with people. I also do not really like small talk, as I find it awkward and uncomfortable, such as when forced to talk with classmates next to me in class. I do not go out of my way to make new friends in any of my classes either. I would say I am also very emotional and sensitive. I would say that I am very sympathetic, and I always try to put myself in other people\u2019s shoes before behaving a certain way/taking action or saying something. I find myself constantly putting others before me, which sometimes is damaging and hurtful to myself, but I am happier when I am able to help others. I also find happiness in other people\u2019s happiness. I would also say that I am pretty good at reading others and quickly catching onto things/reading the room. I can immediately tell if someone\u2019s mood changes, or if they are feeling down or something has happened to them. I consider myself a strong people pleaser. Oftentimes, I find myself caring more about what other people think than about my own thoughts. On that note, I think I do struggle with being self-conscious a lot and being wary of other people\u2019s views and thoughts of me. As I mentioned earlier, I am very emotional and sensitive. I take a lot of things to heart, and I tend to overthink a lot. I overanalyze and overthink about many things, and very often, too. I cry very easily; I cry when watching films and reading books, and I also cry when I am sad or when I am angry. I would say my emotions definitely control me more than I control them. My mood also changes very quickly, so I am up and down a lot.",

Therefore, I tend to take things to heart a lot, and get hurt easily over small things that most likely are not very significant and do not even matter much. I let my emotions control me a lot more than I control them, so I have a lot of mood swings. I also have a short temper, so while I try my best to not show that side of me to friends and peers, I do get irritated and angry easily/often at home, which I always end up regretting after the moments pass. I also am highly sensitive, so I get really annoyed easily and a lot. For instance, if someone acts in a way that is not to my liking, I get annoyed with them. I am very sensitive to noise as well, so loud noises easily scare me and I get very irritated and annoyed around loud people. I also strongly dislike people who are rude and do not have basic manners, especially in public. I am also pretty impatient, along with my short temper. "

I am often mentioned as someone who is bubbly, enthusiastic, willing to do anything, etc. I often feel happy and excited but sometimes I feel tired and my social clock has run dry and just need time to myself. I love being the life of the party but I also like being by myself in my room curled up with a good book away from reality. I am an overly anxious person and even sometimes paranoid thinking who opened that door I thought I shut it at least 20 times a day when in fact I was probably the one that opened the door. I often like to watch Netflix or read a book and escape reality. But I also like being active on my feet doing various activities. I would say I generally am a kind person who has a big heart and I care very much for other human beings. I just want everyone to be happy in life. That said I am very opinionated on certain things. Mainly that human life comes first. I normally want to please everyone. I also am so indecisive it is crazy. Like I can't even decide what I want for dinner or what I want to read next. I hate making decisions and normally love when people do it for me. I like things the way I like things which is hard. I also hate small noises and get really anxious and annoyed at things like other people eating, people typing on their computers, chewing hum, etc. I  am a very particular person but I know that. I hate making new friends, I like for things to stay the same and it is hard for me to branch out and change my ways. I often even experience physical changes when I move around places even just visiting home from school, like a squeezing in my chest which just shows how anxious I get about doing anything in my life. That being said I love hanging out with my family and people I feel comfortable with. It is hard for me to do something if I don't know anyone there. ",

I am also a good listener and am very empathetic with others. I am neat, organized, and order is very important to me. I have a daily routine with my everyday tasks, and go to sleep pretty early when possible. I am down to go out on the weekends (i can be fun), and am adventurous when it comes to exploring new places. I love reading and am academically inclined, and am friendly and charismatic with others. In big social situations I can seem a little anxious, but that is probably my social anxiety. When around good people, I become confident in myself and open. I also am conscientious in all areas of my life to put my best foot forward in everything I do. ",

Sometimes my feelings override my emotions and I can act irrationally. There are other times where I can bottle things up and be passive aggressive if something is bothering me or I've had a bad day. I'm a good listener, but distance myself from others. i have this fear of unbelonging that makes it difficult for me to make friendships, so I can be distant at times. When things aren't going my way, I can be negative and overwhelming to be around. I can be awkward at first meeting, but that is only because I want to make a good first impression and am probably overthinking what to say next in our conversation. "

I am a horrible texter but am really sociable in person. I workout a lot but am not a fitness guru. I like the occasional movie night in with my friends but am also down to go out to SF.

Until I get to know someone well, i wont necessarily engage in animated or advanced conversation and instead choose to take part in conversations instead of lead them. I appreciate the rules/law and those who follow them myself included. I follow routines and plan a lot of parts of my day sometimes to the smallest detail. I am not a risk taker at all. I do not like the idea of getting hurt and only the best of odds can convince me to take a risk. this makes me sound like a square but once I get comfortable around certain people I will open up more and be more talkative and energetic. to top it all off I absolutely hate having to describe myself because I would prefer others to form their own opinions through their own observations and think that generally sharing is a waste of time unless the people who I am sharing with genuinely want to get to know me and I want to get to know them.",

I can be stubborn sometimes and can get emotional at night, but generally speaking, I'm easy-going and can be amiable to everyone. I sometimes do get annoyed easily and can get a bit impatient, but for the most part, especially for people I just meet, I tend to be more welcoming and friendly. My MBTI personality is ENTP-T, so I am technically more extroverted than introverted, and I am an intuitive thinker. I tend to think more future-oriented or bigger picture, but sometimes I can be more of a perfectionist and pick on small details. I get bogged down by small details sometimes and tend to regret. I have a conflicting personality where I always feel something different from what I think, and I never know which one to follow. I can get a bit sensitive sometimes, but other times I could be quite bold and carefree. I'd say that overall my mood changes a ton, so it's hard to describe my personality as a whole. I tend to be more spontaneous over planning, although I would like to be more of an organized planner. I am more turbulent than assertive as I tend to value what other people think too much / make it seem more of a big deal than it actually is. My favorite feeling is excitement since it always lightens up my mood and gets my entire body energized. Usually when I'm excited, I'm a lot more fun and nicer to people around me. In the morning, I could get grouchy and a bit more impatient sometimes. I get paranoid very easily and used to have a big problem of overthinking everything and getting too nervous for small things that are quite trivial. ",

I think that becomes an issue because I would become more turbulent and harsh on myself when making decisions, and when I make the wrong choice, I would regret.

I am a very creative person who enjoys taking a couple risks every now and then. While others have described me as confident and carefree, I feel as though I am also a kind and compassionate person. If you ever want to just vent and talk I have an open ear to hear anything you have to say. I really enjoy writing and art things-so expect a lot of pens and paintbrushes lying around my desk and bed. Another interesting fact about me is that I love gardening and take care of three little cacti currently. One of my cacti is struggling to stand up so I made a little prosthetic (I'm not an engineer or anything but a little bit of creativity and some toothpicks goes a long way) for it to be able to stand up better and be able to grow up big and strong just like the other cacti. While this is random, I think it really goes to show how I pay attention to the small little details about what goes around me and I try to help others to the best of my ability. If you ever need any advice I would be more than happy to offer it. I love being able to mentor and help others.  I usually like to talk a lot as well so be prepared to hear all my stories! I pick up on new hobbies very quickly, so if there is anything new out there I will pick it up quite quickly. Especially if it's something a lot of people around me talk about. For example, I recently got into Genshin Impact just because a lot of my friends told me how fun it was.  ",

If I see something while I'm out one day and it reminds me of you, I'll likely pick it up and gift it to you. I have a person policy that I try to live by, which is to try and venmo people as little as possibly. When you constantly venmo for meals, trips, etc. I think that takes away from your relationship with someone because it breaks dow trust and generosity between people. I like to say \"I'll get it this time, and you can get it next time.\" I also consider myself a pretty artsy person. I used to be really into acting, and I do still enjoy it, but I don't perform as often now. I love painting as well and playing the ukulele. Arts and crafts in general are my thing!\n\n I have been told I'm pretty smart, but I didn't really start believing it until recently. I think I am much more of an english/writing/social sciences person rather than a hardcore STEM person, which may be where that insecurity has come from in the past. Someon who is stereotypically very smart seems to always be into math or physics or something. I also really love to journal. It gives me some quiet peaceful time, and I enjoy the self-reflection. I tried to keep a gratitude journal for a while, but I;'m someone who is bad at doing things super consistently. I always say I'm going to dosomething every day, but then I get off track. The only thing I am even close to being that consistent about is brushing my teeth and doing my skincare routine.\n\nI really like giving back to people as well. I am working as behavior technician for autisic kids, and I am having so much fun doing it! I have learned through this job that I really enjoy working with kids, it's always a fun environment. I also find a lot of fulfillment doing this job because I greatly feel like it matters a lot. That's why I wouldn't want to go into more businessy jobs like consulting. I feel like I'm a very intrinsicly motivated person and when I thoroughly enjoy and care about something I will REALLY give it my all. But at the same time, if I am not intrinsicly motivated about something, it is EXTREMELY hard to motivate myself to do it and put good effort in. ",

I could definitely be healthier in that aspect. I think I can have a little bit of an ego at times, particularly when it comes to physical appearance. I think I am a pretty attractive person and it can definitely cross over into the vain area. This one is a lot harder to write about. I also think I am not good at confrontation.

I think a lifelong project/goal im working towards is being a more confident person. I want to work on being more attentive and speaking about my feelings more often, and I also just want to be a more open and friendly person in general. I'd say im more on the introverted side, but I am also down to do spontaneous things and be adventurous with the right people. im shy at first but once I get to know you and feel more comfortable around you, I will not shut up.

I tend to put people on a pedastal and am quick to see others as better or more valuable than me. I think that stems from my self esteem issues. a lot of what I do and say is influenced by my tendency to people please, and its a bad trait I want to fix. I'm also quiet and shy in general and people tend to mistaken that as me being rude or self centered. I also have trouble taking up space; a lot of my first impressions have not gone the way I would have liked. I have adhd so its hard sometimes for me to pay attention to what you are saying, but I promise I am trying to get better at that. I also have autism, which is something I still have lots to learn about, but I've noticed I have a hard time picking up on social cues and have trouble communicating at times, and understanding what you are saying. communication in general is something I struggle with, which in the past have made people think I'm angry at them, or better than them. Its a lifelong process of learning about this disability, but its something I don't want to have to hide. "

Additionally, I am a very service-oriented person. I feel joy and satisfaction in helping others and sacrificing my time to volunteer on service events. I would also describe myself as friendly, but people may feel intimidated when meeting me for the first time; people say that I sometimes a bit too mature for my age, but this may be because I grew up always being the youngest in my batch or school grade.

I am not very good at waiting for something and tend to hurry whatever task is given to me. It developed myself an organized person. I plan a lot to make things happen on time because of many other aforementioned traits of me. In the case of moving into a dorm and living with a person I've never met before, I would tell him; I am very extroverted and outgoing. Maybe, you should expect me bringing my friends sometimes. But don't worry, I am quite organized person and wouldn't leave any mess behind. I wake up at ~~for this and would come back at ~~.

You\u2019ll understand my enthusiasm when I tell you about the countless hours I\u2019ve spent in Nigeria\u2019s traffic (in pidgin: go-slow) for my whole life. You\u2019ll hear more pidgin when I\u2019m filming TeaTime episodes (feel free to join!). I may code-switch between Indian and American when calling my family every day. Yes, every day, meaning my family is now and forevermore your family. \n\nRoomie, what's the meaning of life? Do you believe in soulmates? What's your attachment style? Essentially, I love late-night chats about everything from social phenomena to existential questions. They're weirdly perfect mental breaks, leading to new perspectives and guaranteed hilarity. These range from minutes to hours - so join me as we attempt to uncover life's truths while disastrously cooking (unless you can cook - that would be great). \n\nYou may not get away with feeling down without me noticing. When you randomly receive adorable animal GIFs or iced coffees on your desk, know it\u2019s with love...and to check in on you. If you don\u2019t want to talk about it, we can listen to my \u2018get up, get moving\u2019 playlist - because music can help turn a frown upside down. ;) Seriously though, whenever you need pick-me-ups, either physically to boost energy levels with my turmeric health shots, or mentally by having someone to listen, I\u2019m here. \n\nI hope you love spontaenous trips and listening to music to accompany daily activities - because I sure do! I love taking time to explore new genres of music or new areas of the city. I think I would explain myself as an extreme social butterfly that also enjoys chill night's in (occasionally). I also love painting and expressing myself creatively - so I would love to have paint nights and room redecorations. I think I can get bored easily, but once something interests me I can go into hours and hours of deep diving to learn more. I would say I feel emotions a lot and I feel them very strongly. I express myself through... random screaming and singing. But don't worry - you'll be able to tell that I'm just letting out frustration or excitement. I am admittedly a night owl and ashamedly not the tidiest person. But I will have random outbursts of energy to clean up our room and my spaces. The messiness of my side of the room can be directly correlated with how stressed/anxious I am - tip to understand me better. I am a hopeless romantic but in the most hopeful way haha - i love romanticizing life and the small serendipities of every day. \n\nTo years of cheers, tears, and conversations in our ears!\n",

I appreciate and really wish to have other people be vulnerable and confide in me however I do not believe that I can easily open up. Part of this comes from my fear of abandonment and that my problems and emotions might be too overwhelming for others to handle. I think my mental health is really dependent on my level of closeness to others in my life. I really value my family's opinions, which is good until it can be bad. I think it can sometimes hold me back from doing things I might want to do and can mask parts of my personality.\n\nI also really struggle with my self worth and image of myself, both physically and mentally. I am AN OVERTHINKER! in all caps and no barriers. I think of every scenario that could potentially happen and navigate my interactions very carefully. I think I am slightly apologistic of others and it can lead me to being a pushover more often than not. I am also very non-confrontational - which doesn't pair well with the pushover and overthinking side of me ahaha. "

        "text": "Hi, my name is Sophia Coughlin and I am attempting to describe my personality in 10 minutes. In some ways, it's absurd to think that I can capture msyelf in my own subjectively and limited time. I am an intense, loyal, critical, joyous, judgmental, silly, tough exterior jelly bean interior person. I'm clean, although sometimes messy (though never dirty) and I enjoy being around people who I love and am close with. At the same time, I am also an anxious person, who has struggled with depression and a variety of insecurities. I'm super excited to grow and learn from these things however. I feel very equipped to be able to struggle and come out okay - maybe that's naive, but I'm feeling a lot of joy in my life at the moment. I know it goes up and down, and I'm realizing that with the upcoming school year, my sense of joy is going to be more difficult to maintain. I'm also a very curious person - I think in many ways that drives a lot of what I do. I absolutely hate Berkeley and struggle with a lot of judgement here (from within myself) towards others). I'm thinking about trying to say nothing negative of people for x amount of time - maybe a couple months, maybe a year? It's funny that I wrote that I was feeling so much joy because I often struggle with feeling completely miserable, angry, and judgmental. Call it a mood, call my temperament. People tell me they love my smile ( not in the creepy old man way, but close family and friends). I think I can provide a lot of joy to people around me...Maybe that's silly of me to think (self-centered?). Anyways, I would never ever describe myself so openly to a potential roommate lol. But in these 10 mins, I hope it's been absolutely clear that I captured my essence within the space of 26 letters. Maybe this should be my new talent lol. You now know me completely and so well. Ure welcome. Wait, I can keep writing even though the timers up! I guess you'll never know how perfectly I described myself in just \"10 minutes\". Plot twist - Clearly my ADHD brain did not think to read to the end of the message. \n",

I'm not dirty or highly messy but I always am in rush and sometimes don't have time to clean up my room and pick up my clothes for 2-3 days. I like to have a lot of people around me and would describe myself as someone who has social anxiety but wants to overcome it everyday by having a lot of people around her. I would not lie to someone just to save their feelings, if an outfit is a bad outfit, I am letting you know so you can change it. I highly believe in this persian quote that says \"A friends says it and an enemy says I wanted to say it\" so if I am a good friend I would tell you your mistakes. I also love sharing food and eating food out, I would love to try new places even though I always end up eating the same thing over and over again. I work a lot too. On the other hand, I think sometimes I can't handle some of my friends due to some little stuff that can annoy me, like asking my grades, how much money I have, what I do as a job and I'm not saying you won't know this information as a roommate/friend but I hate when people ask these questions just to compare themselves with me. My love life is a mess but it's all good, cause I love to be in my peace era but I do sometimes tell my friends I want a love life but at the same time run away from it, so a little bit of both things. Lastly, I am obsessed with my ethnicity, I come from a cultural rich country and I want to make sure people know the good side of my culture that I experienced first hand. ",

I sometimes think if a person is really my friend or she just using me or if a person really likes me, if I'm being annoying with a friend, if I'm being too loud, too much, and sometimes this shows in my action, like at a social event I suddenly go silent and want to leave because I feel like I might be extra or too much. I don't think this is relate to my childhood but more related to how sometimes I feel deep down that I don't wanna hang out with someone but don't have the guts to say no, so I feel like what if they are feeling the same way to me.

I love social settings because being surrounded by people gives me a sense of comfort and sometimes excitement.

My definition of relaxing will be talking to people because conversation not only takes my mind off of things, but also gives me an opportunity to learn from others and grow as a person. I am also very empathetic. IN more detail, I would say I am a pro at putting myself in other people's shoes, sometimes even to excessively. I can connect my emotions with others very easily and immediately able to relate and understand one's situation just by listening. I great at observing people which makes me more often or not considerate and caring because I can sort of \"read\" what people need. I can sometimes be too stubborn or a perfectionist. If something isn't done in my way, I would take over, thinking that I can do it better. Ironically, I'm also open minded. If I know I'm in the wrong I wouldn't stay stubborn and argue about it, I would agree and try to improve as much as I possible. I'm also humorous. I love making people laugh because when the people around me are happy it makes me happy too. I always use my humor to lighten up the mood and make things fun. I'm a bit avoidant. Confrontations aren't my thing and it takes me a long time to build up courage and actually complete the task. I would usually try to distract myself from all sorts of thing so i don't feel the negative emotions that I have at that moment. ",

When it comes to studying, I like to go out and find a cafe or a library to do my homework instead of staying at home. Surrounding by other people motivates me to do things more efficiently. I would say generally I am an extrovert, however, sometimes I might be similar to an introvert as I need to restore energy by being alone at home. ",

Another negative aspect of me is that I tend to procrastinate a lot. I do most of my assignment at the very last minute.

I love making new friends, but it is hard for me sometimes since socializing is difficult. So I would be really happy if you tried to talk to me first. And after I'm comfortable, I feel like I can start talking more. On the surface, I'm a positive person and very open-minded. I am almost always down to hang out unless I'm busy or I already have other plans. On the other hand, I tend to sign up for too much (academically and in my personal life). So there is a lot on my plate and I tend to overwork myself. I get kinda sad sometimes when I'm alone or too stressed, so being around people is nice too!\nAlso, I would like to think I'm a nice and kind person! I'm very adaptable so I can adjust to whomever I'm living with. \nSome of my favorite activities include drawing, playing video games (specifically rhythm games, but I like the chill calming ones as well like Stardew Valley), watching anime (my favorite genre is psychological and slice of life, but I watch almost anything), and listening to music. Since I am very open minded, I have a lot of hobbies so I can bond with people! I love spending time with people! But I do have some limits. I would say I'm like a shy and kinda anxious extrovert or sometimes an outgoing introvert. I love spending time with people, but then after a whole day of nonstop socializing, I can be pretty tired and I need my alone time as well. ",

I have some friends who would leave me out of outings and I also would like to know why. I wonder if it has something to do with my personality. Do I talk too much? Am I doing something that annoys people? I can also be competitive in some situations and I am working on trying to be a better \"loser\" and have good sportsmanship.

In terms of each word, I would say I'm engaging because I like to grab people's attention. I want to change the subject if a conversation is slow or awkward. Whether it be unintentionally or intentionally, I love to make people laugh. Even more so, I love to make people comfortable as I know how it feels to be isolated. Patience is also a virtue of mine and comes into play mostly when I'm discussing difficult subjects with those around me. I like to nob, listen, and reassure others that I am in fact absorbing what they are sharing with me. Finally, I am absolutely strong-headed because although I am patient, I like to have things go my way. I may be able to see the world in a way that is not black and white, but I know what I want. My stubbornness allows me to present as confident, but in all honesty, it's not confidence. It's simply the fact that I feel that I know best. In my heart, I know what is truly right and wrong. ",

Although I can of course be on my own, I tend to seek out popele. I enjoy the stimuli and my social battery thrives when I'm engaging with others.

I'm the classic will sit on the couch for five hours straight watching re-runs kind of person. I think I am also fairly fickle; I change my mind frequently. I enjoy music and singing- I sing in an acapella group and it brings me a lot of joy. I try to be kind because I really value improving other people's lives, even if it's just someone smiling at something I said or laughing at a joke I made. I am patient with people who need it, like little kids (I work with children on the spectrum so this helps) but lack patience with the people closest to me like family members. I'm very honest if that's what people want but I try to not say hurtful things unless it is important. I am at my happiest when I feel part of a community, but I am fairly introverted/shy and have bad social anxiety, so sometimes in social situations I have trouble being my true self because my brain is panicking and is just trying to get words out. I am a fiercely loyal friend- I am still close with the first friend I made in kindergarten (she said I was required to be a bridesmaid at her wedding which made me happy). I would say the biggest motivating factor in my behavior and the choices that I make is that I like to feel needed. My favorite dog is my grandfather's dog because he wants constant attention, and I like to feel needed so I'll give him lots of pets and will play with him constantly. I think I am also fairly smart, specifically in critical, quick thinking. I have trouble with strategic thinking, like the type required for strategy board games, mostly because I have trouble focussing hard enough on something for that long. I am also not very creative, I have trouble generating ideas but I am very good at assessing them. I would say the only area I'm creative in is in music, and even then I think it's more just that I like it enough to put in the effort to be creative since it doesn't come naturally to me. ",

Arguing is the kind of quick, critical thinking I am good at and so sometimes I get carried away because I am enjoying it and I forget to prioritize respect and kindness. I think I also have a lot of trouble with showing emotion in front of people- I trust pretty much no one these days. I have PTSD and the trauma that caused it was due to someone I trusted very much, and since then I have trouble thinking that anyone actually likes or values my presence in their life.

Even though I am a pleaser, I don't always necessarily enjoy that because there are people who have taken advantage of me and have used me, so when things boil over I basically explode in the sense where it always ends with us not being friends at all. I also am not that forgiving in the sense where if someone crosses me, then that's that.

I don't like spending time in large groups, I prefer small group/one on one interactions. I do enjoy socializing, but I need time to recharge on my own. I would also say I am a fairly independent person. I prefer to figure out and navigate situations alone. I take pride in figure out problems by myself. I have a fair amount of anxiety. I often worry what others think of me and also worry about doing things incorrectly. This anxiety tends to hold me back from trying new things and meeting new people. I'm not exactly sure what my favorite activies are at the moment. I wouldn't say I am passionate about anything in particular but I do enjoy being outdoors, exploring new places, and reading. It think this lack of hobbies is largely due to anxiety/perfectionism, which often holds me back from trying things outside of my comfort zone. \nI try not take myself too seriously. I often use self-deprecating humor to make people laugh and make them feel comfortable. It's important to me that others feel accepted when they are with me. I would say I'm a fairly non-judgemental person and am accepting of differences in others. \n",

I am an overthinker, but i also like to take risks and like to try new things like activities or foods. I love exploring and being adventurous so i am always down for anything.

I get upset when i see spaces like the kitchen and living room dirty because i enjpy clean spaces.

I also overthink like crazy to the point where I may cause stress or anxiety for others around me as well when that is my opposite intention. Sometimes I am also emotionally unstable where I can feel very fulfilled and happy but it turns sad very quickly if I overthink the situation."

I have a younger sister, who I'd also say is my best friend. My dad has never been around, but my mother has an awesome partner who has been there for me in a fatherly figure. My mother is very silly, goofy, funny. However, she is also very independent. I picked up on a lot of her and my sister's personality traits because, for most of my life, it was only me, my sister, and her. I'd like to think that I'm also very silly and independent. I'm also very understanding. I like to view all sides of a story to make the most of any possible outcomes. My zodiac sign is Libra, but I'm not too into that haha. I have two cats, they're brothers! One's more of my sister's cat though. His name is Stinky & my cat's name is Milo. I love them both though. I think one day I might turn out to be one of those \"crazy cat ladies\" because I would do anything for them. Umm, in general, I love to laugh, I love to meet new people (even though I'm very shy at first), and I love learning new things. One of my favorite activities would be watching movies, although, I'm not very \"active\" during that haha. I enjoy scary movies. My favorite color is blue, but I also realllllyyyyy love pink. Overall, I'm a very genuine person. ",

I also tend to reach for deeper experiences in my relationships with myself and others. My soul yearns for deeper meanings and understandings that I believe I can pull from almost everything. I also tend to be very emotional and for better or worse can feel things extremely deeply. I also have a defiance to me that allows me to understand what I do and don't deserve from this life and I pursue and handle things accordingly. I am very warm inviting and energetic. I have a constant flow of ideas about things to do with my life (big or small) and am constantly pursuing them. I get upset when I believe things are unjust or unfair. I also get extremely protective over people I love. I am an unconditional lover of everyone in my life. I am my own worst critique and am constantly in my own head. It is never anyone's fault but my own. I am very intent on being the solution to all problems I face and full-heartedly live by the idea that you aren't owed your own happiness and instead have to create it. I am creative and logical as a thinker. Mostly creative. I enjoy most things pertaining to the outdoors, if healing elements are real I'm almost positive mine is the earth.",

I have unconditional love for others but don't accept it for myself. Something about me wants to give and is afraid to receive. Partly because I don't want other people to go through the trouble of that and partly because I'm scared to find out if they even would or not, in the first place. I think that is the biggest negative aspect in my personality as mentioned in the previous writing exercise but here it is in depth. This single aspect of who I am creates many unexpected sadnesses in my life and is therefore why I consider it negative."

I always plan outings for my friends and bring up fun topics to talk about when we're bored. I prioritize school a lot and like to hang out with my friends occasionally. My entire life I have been working towards my dream of becoming a physician, so at times I may talk about being a pre-med a lot but I try to not bring it up since I don't want to make it my whole personality.

I am very organized and responsible when it comes to commitments (assignments, projects, research, etc.). Besides studying, another big part of my life is art. I make art myself through watercolor, pencil sketching, and digital media. I enjoy learning, listening to music eating cuisines, and trying out a variety of activities (meditation, exercising, hiking, cooking, etc.). I tend to be sensitive and even sentimental sometimes, but these traits of mine only make me better at empathizing. I feel deeply for other people and it makes me good at listening and understanding other people. I am also a risk-taker when it comes to challenging myself academically and socially. I love stepping outside my comfort zone to explore my limits and I feel like those adventurous experiences only make my life more meaningful. I tend to be quiet most of the time because I enjoy being alone and peaceful. I usually try to live in the present and make the full of every moment. Overall, I am strong and independent (and radiant!). If you ever want to have a person to talk to or share your life with, feel free to come to me! ",

I care deeply about all of my family and friends and will do anything to help them--often dropping everything I'm doing to help them if needed. I would say I am an emotional and sentimental person as I often feel empathetic to others' experiences, and often crying while watching touching movies(or just scenes that I find touching in movies across all genres). However, I think because of my extreme emotionality, I tend to also be judgmental and somewhat quick to judge others. But, I would say I am also pretty open to changing my initial opinions/reactions about someone once I learn more about them. I am also very anxious and worried about most things. I am a perfectionist, yet I procrastinate a lot. I am hard on myself, but sometimes too lenient. My favorite feeling is when I'm with a bunch of people I love and cherish and we talk, laugh, joke, and appreciate each others' presence. I often find myself thinking, \"Remember this moment, remember how you were feeling here,\" when I'm with people I love.",

I can be very lazy, especially when it comes to working and academics. Yet, hypocritically, I feel imposter syndrome and compare myself a lot to my peers when it comes to these things. I always think I'm never doing enough, but when I look back at my past experiences, I realize I have done a fair amount of things, but it never felt that way in the moment. I also get jealous of and judge other people's experiences, ambitions, career goals, and accomplishments. There's a part of me that always feels like I need to be the best and better than everyone, and that I am the only one that can do certain things. I get mad at myself when I receive a bad grade or a less desirable grade, but I don't do anything to study or work harder. I have high ambitions, but I never feel like I can do it. Sometimes, I'm too emotional and can't handle how I feel. I break into outbursts or cry when I'm angry and it makes me feel like an immature child. I have lots of faults, but I'm trying to change for the better."

They look at how we deal with ups and downs, celebrate good times, and manage relationships. Getting to know these aspects of personality can help us understand ourselves and others better, leading to improved self-awareness and healthier relationships. It's like having a map that helps navigate the complex journey of life, highlighting our strengths and areas where we can grow.  \nImagine it as a specific set of ingrained habits of thought and emotion, interwoven with our actions, that makes each of us distinctly who we are. These traits are quite stable; they don\u2019t change easily, though they can evolve with life\u2019s experiences and as we grow. \nOur personality is shaped by a dyad of our genetic makeup and our life experiences. The family, culture, and social circles we grow up in all throw in bits and pieces that stick with us, influencing how we see the world and behave within it. For instance, one person might be naturally outgoing, thriving on social interaction, while another might prefer the quiet, introspective solitude.\n\n\n",

        "negative_text": "I have a tendency towards binge eating, which could indicate an inclination towards seeking comfort or emotional expression through food. This trait is often reflective of a person who experiences their emotions vividly and might use food as a way to cope with stress or discomfort. Being confrontational and having a quick temper are traits that suggest I do not shy away from conflict and are quick to defend my beliefs or assert my opinions. This can be a powerful trait in situations where advocacy or directness is necessary. However, it can also be challenging in social interactions where diplomacy and patience are required. My acknowledgment of not being a patient listener aligns with this, indicating a personality that values quick and decisive communication over prolonged discussion. My high moral expectations of how others should treat each other reveal a principled nature. I likely hold strong ethical beliefs and expect others to adhere to similar standards. This trait can make me a moral compass in my social circles, guiding others towards fairness and ethical behavior, but it might also lead to disappointment or frustration when others do not meet these expectations.\nDespite these challenges, I also have a rich array of interests that bring joy and fulfillment to my life. My passion for food, travel, and music suggests a deep appreciation for diverse experiences and cultures. These interests not only offer opportunities for joy and relaxation but also provide avenues for me to explore and engage with the world in vibrant and meaningful ways.\nMy enjoyment of alone time coupled with a craving for social engagement and outdoor activities illustrates a dynamic social rhythm. I appreciate solitude, which allows me to recharge and reflect, yet I also seek the stimulation of social interactions and the rejuvenation that comes from being outdoors. This balance helps maintain my emotional and mental health, giving me the space to enjoy me own company and the energy to engage with others.  In navigating the complexities of my personality, it's beneficial to recognize and embrace both my strengths and areas for growth. Understanding my tendency towards intense emotional expressions can lead to better strategies for managing stress and conflict. Simultaneously, nurturing my passions and allowing myself ample time for both solitude and social interaction can enhance my overall well-being and satisfaction in life."

Often, especially in social interactions, I overthink the actions of myself and others, and often have to try to talk myself out of feeling unreasonably jealous or moody (side effect of anxious attachment), especially to those I'm close with. Sometimes, when I feel like a relationship is growing distant, I will do things that contribute to that feeling rather than working to strengthen it, another impact of an anxious attachment style. Due to my depression, there are times when I get more depressed (depressive episodes), even on medication; I can become stagnant, unresponsive, unmotivated (i.e. not attending to household duties as well, not being as responsive in conversation, being more socially isolated). These are all things that I'm working on combating, that I have ways of thinking and strategies to work around, but they still occur sometimes, and it's a me problem, not a you problem. "

I think this is why I have a hard time developing long-term friendships that last from one stage of my life to the other. When I am with those people, I do anything I can for them and am extremely loyal; but when I move on, that relationship ceases in my mind. \n\nI also have high expectations of other people and am often disappointed when they don't meet them. I know this is unfair, but it is difficult to accept the worse parts of humanity. THis can lead me to be negative about life "

I like going out to enjoy nature and do fun activities, but I also enjoy staying home to read or watch movies. I am pretty friendly with new people but once I really get to know people is when my outgoing side comes out more. I think I'm very considerate to other people and try to be as accomodating as I can to others without disturbing my needs as well. I am decently clean, honest, and busy a lot of the time. I play softball here so my schedule starts early in the day and I am busy with practice and weights for a large majority of the day. I enjoy cooking and baking. I love going to the beach, just being outside in general. ",

Due to this, different people see many different sides of my personality and there may be many different perceptions of my personality from others. I enjoy artistic activities and I feel that that fuels the way I think and approach problem solving. I love developing new and creative ways to accomplish tasks and finding solutions in unexpected places. I also enjoy taking the time to think through problems and situations before responding to them. I feel as though I have many facets to my personality and which facet is present is highly dependent on the context that I find myself in. This is another factor that further contributes to the diverse array of perceptions there are of me. I believe that I am a funny/ witty person and enjoy cracking jokes and consuming comedic media but I also despise humor that is dependent on being at the expense of others. I am a kind person and I forgive people easily but also have a tendency to move on quickly from relationships where people may not show an equal degree of kindness for me. I also remember many things about the people around me (often to their surprise) so I feel as though I embody the idea of \"forgive but don't forget\" quite well. I love making the people around me laugh and alongside that, I also love telling stories to engage and entertain others. I strive to create inclusive, comfortable spaces in all social settings that I find myself in and am always willing to reach out to people who may be on their own, outside of the group. I love animals and nature so I often find myself hiking or going on long walks despite being (currently) very out of shape. I love to read and learn and expand my knowledge of all things, especially languages, psychology, cultures, and art. Currently I am very into creating embroidered gifts for my friends and I love to do other types of crafts such as knitting, sewing, crochet, etc. as well. ",

When I am in a bad mood, I tend to retreat into myself and do not communicate to others why I am behaving in this way. In general, I feel as though I struggle with transparency in communication and recognizing my own emotional limits. I have a very high pain tolerance (both physically and emotionally) which often results in me pushing myself in scenarios where I am suffering to the extent that I burn out (either physically or emotionally). I tend to prioritize others over myself and grow resentful if the sentiment is not reciprocated (despite logically recognizing that most people will prioritize themselves over others). In the past, I struggles a lot with lashing out negative emotions at others despite it not being directed at them and while I have developed better coping mechanisms over the years, I still sometimes let my emotions bleed into situations where they do not belong. In terms of issues with communication, I often rely on sarcasm and humor to communicate negative emotion rather than using more rational dialogue focused on addressing the issue at hand and solving the problem that needs to be addressed.

I love chatting with people casually and getting to know them better, even if it's some banter on the bus or asking a stranger a question. I am really passionate about mental health and mental illness awareness, so if you show even the slightest bit of interest in it I divulge a lot about my dream to be a psychiatrist and why my career is so important to me. Through my experiences with Bipolar I Disorder, I have learned to be a strongly empathetic person with good active listening skills. People feel comfortable to share very personal things about themselves because I create a safe space for whoever I'm talking with to encourage them to share their feelings. I would say that I have a great sense of humor and am easily excitable. I don't take myself too seriously and over the past couple of years I have developed my ability to be emotionally vulnerable with others. Although socializing does give me energy and I need it to function, I am also introverted in the sense that I need plenty of downtime by myself. I consider myself very nerdy and I like things like video games, makeup, all sorts of music, and musicals. I enjoy cartoons. I would say that I am very in touch with my inner child because I honestly feel like a child most of the time...I have a hard time with focusing and am prone to daydream. Practical things do not come as easily, while creative endeavors and abstract ideas do. I love writing and putting meaning into every word I write. I love writing poems. I feel that I am someone who is good to live with because of my friendliness, good sense of humor, and down to earth nature. I deeply appreciate open and honest, respectful communication. Overall, I want to dedicate my lives to helping others work through the darkest parts of their own lives. I believe that there is always hope, and even though I can get stuck in negative moods I always circle back to positivity. My motto that I've adopted from the former Surgeon General, who also has Bipolar I: Stigma festers in the dark but scatters in the light.",

I have developed more confidence over the last couple of years, but I would say I still have a couple deep rooted insecurities, one centering around my physical appearance and the other about how difficult my STEM classes have been for me. I'm not used to struggling academically, so I never learned proper studying and time management skills. I once had confidence in my intelligence and academic abilities, and that has greatly diminished. It makes me feel discouraged and deep down I worry about not being good enough to go to med school. One thing about me, though, is that I'm very stubborn. Because of my illness, I know what it's like to be in a very low place. My mental health experiences make my current journey less difficult in comparison. I might continue to shed a lot of tears, but I will continue down this path because I feel it's where I belong in the world."

My biggest prizes in life are my parents, pet, family, and friends, so most of my time will be centered around them, but I also make sure to prioritize my alone time which is important to me. I also like to help people as much as I can. I am determined and responsible, however there are days where I feel lazier than usual and just want to chill. Still, I like to be organized and neat whenever I can. ",

I lack boundaries with some people, which prevents me from feeling satisfied with some of my relationships with loved ones. I think that sometimes I am too nice, hence people have the privilege of treating me like a doormat. I also never get angry, and so I tend to bottle up my emotions in order to keep the other person happy. I sometimes compare myself with others who are better, more outgoing, and prettier than me, which isn't a good habit to keep.

I have always been sort of an extrovert because I love interacting with other people, however, I can also be introverted at times and just want time for myself. When I feel extroverted I love going out with friends to parties, sporting games, a park, or just hanging out with them at home. I have always loved sports and am competitive so I like to seek out a bit of a challenge when it comes to competition. I like being active whether I am going on a run, dancing, playing a sport, or anything along those lines. When I am feeling introverted I enjoy doing things like reading, playing video games, watching tv and movies, listening to music I like, or maybe even just taking a nap or going for a run by myself. My favorite things to do are laugh with friends, be active, and eat good food. My family heritage consists of cultures with a lot of good food so when I am not eating that kind of food, I enjoy trying foods from other culture. I believe that I am a very understanding person, not quick to anger, who likes to hear all sides of a story before making a decision on where I might stand. I think I am a bit witty and can make people laugh which is nice. I always want to make sure everyone in a room feels included so we all can have a good time.

        "text": "First off, I am a very introverted person. I very much value my time alone and prefer to be alone or with just a few very close friends most of the time. I dislike parties and loud, crowded social events for the most part. Despite this I am quite open to new experiences and I enjoy going out with a few friends to eat or get drinks or play a sport in the park. I am pretty agreeable and dislike arguments (especially over minute things). I try to make sure the people around me are happy and am somewhat of a \"people-pleaser.\" I'm a very flexible person when it comes to almost everything. I can typically make do with whatever I'm given and am very low maintenance. I flip flop between being confident and proud and being insecure. I spend a lot of time in the gym so my self esteem will go back and forth as well. Some days I feel good about how I look, other days I don't. I would say I am a little bit on the lazy side when it comes to academics, I will typically do the minimum, but when it comes to chores around the house, I will get things done quickly and efficiently. I hate living in a dirty apartment, whenever I see dirt anywhere I clean it almost immediately so my apartment is always quite tidy. I love music, it brings me a peace and happiness I don't find in many other places so I will almost always be listening to music with my headphones on (I'm listening to music writing this right now). I also tend to be pretty rational and aware. I never really make impulsive decisions or stress about unnecessary things because I have a very \"go-with-the-flow\" attitude towards most things in life. It is what it is, as I like to say. I'll always push myself to be better, but there are certain things that are out of my control and that's okay. This thought process helps me stay positive and relaxed most of the time.",

I tend to make excuses as to why I can't go out or hang out, so getting me out of the house is quite difficult. I am also pretty indecisive when I actually do go out, people will ask what I want to eat or what I want to do and my go to answer is \"up to you,\" but I'm trying to get better at deciding things. I may be a little bit too much of a fitness person/gym rat and I spend a lot of time in the gym or preparing healthy meals which is another reason I don't eat out much. I will make friends pretty quickly but I have a hard time continuing to go out or make plans, so a lot of my friendships will fall through rather quickly. "

I would consider myself a clean person but there are moments where I get overwhelmed and busy that my room may be a little chaotic but overall it is organized. I'm also a very emotional person. I tend to take what people say to heart and sometimes I find words hurting me. I guess that would make me pretty sensitive. When I get upset or sad, I tend to cry. I'm usually a pretty happy person. I don't usually get mad or upset but I do find myself getting sad often. Even though I'm a social person, I also require some time to myself to decompress and relax. It's easy for me to feel drained if I don't take that time for myself.

I am respectful of the person I'm living with and can easily reach a compromise to suit both of our needs. I study two majors and a minor, work a research job on campus, and have a position with the sport I'm involved in (cycling). Hence, I'm quite busy and will pretty much keep out of my roommate's hair (although my lights might be on all the time). I've been told my laugh is contagious, so I hope my roommate and I will be able to bond over shared interests (even if that interest is simply going to Cal together) and joke about the undergraduate experience. I also enjoy a good time, but I definitely won't crash the place. I love to read, play guitar, and reminisce. I'm also quite nostalgic and a hopeless romantic.",

I can be handy and love tinkering, and I love exploring technology and new innovation. I am the small town loving kind of guy and had traditional values on relationships, often staying overly attached. I'm very involved with my church community as well as my friends in politics.

However sometimes, I do like to spend time with myself to clear my head or rest. I would definitely call myself an extrovert. but sometimes I have introverted tendencies. \n\nIf I know someone pretty well, I feel comfortable to be 100% myself. If I am really comfortable with someone (my best friends, family, boyfriend), then I find that I have a little bit more of a direct/harsher personality. I am very tell-it-like-it-is, but not in a mean way at all, but I think that people are aware that my personality is very straight forward. I am very vocal about how I am feeling emotionally most of the time. When I am upset about something, I think that I have a difficulty time hiding this. One thing about my personality is that I am not superficial at all. I feel like I have been through a lot in my life which has all taught me a lot and forced me to mature and grow up at a very fast rate. I do not really enjoy spending time with people who are more surface level; I genuinely care so much about the people in my life and I love getting to know new people!\n\nBecause I am pretty extroverted, I like to spend time with other people and live an active lifestyle. I get really anxious when I stay inside of a house all day or do minimal activity. I am a Registered Yoga Instructor, so I am very into health and fitness. I also love being outside and going on walks and hikes. However, I do enjoy resting and not doing much on occasion. \n\nI would say that I am pretty clean and organized. I like having a clean space around me, although I am not a neat freak who needs things to be perfect all of the time. Definitely having a clean space allows me to focus more and makes me feel more calm. I think that I was really influenced by my mother, who instilled in me that I should make my bed everyday and keep my space organized. \n",

I think that in the back of my mind, I feel as if these individuals will not go anywhere, so I do not mind being direct/harsher with them. For example, when my sister does something which really bothers me and we get in a fight, I can say some mean things to her which I later regret. I get very heated in the moment and then I regret acting out when I am more calm. Another example is when my boyfriend used something of mine without asking, and in the moment, I was so angry and called him names. This is definitely wrong and I think that I am so comfortable with him that in the moment, I did not think anything of it. However, when I calmed down, I regretted making it such a big deal. \n\nAnother aspect of my personality is that it is hard for me to trust people, and I think this influences my relationships. I had a really complicated relationship with my dad growing up, and he passed away when I was in high school, and this definitely has influenced my ability to trust. I am also slightly a perfectionist/obsessive about things, and hold myself to very high standards. I took this too far when I became obsessive over my food intake after my dad passed away and I developed an eating disorder. I definitely can get obsessive/hyper-focused on some things. "

In situations like choosing where to go out to eat, or what to do tonight, I am more the person who will let others suggest and choose. I will give my own input about things I don't like to do, but I generally will not offer up suggestions unless prompted to. However that does not mean I will follow everything. I am definitely a more reserved, homebody type person. I tend to do activities at home like playing video games, board games, or watching movies. While I am open to new experiences and do enjoy activities outside the house, I am generally less inclined to them and will often need to be asked multiple times to do them. Nevertheless, I appreciate being included in activities even if I choose not to join in them. For example, my current housemates are active and one asks me to go to the rock climbing gym with him. I probably only will say yes 1 out of every 3 times, but I welcome the invitations. Or a past roommate invited me to some parties. I said no more than I said yes but also, welcomed the invitations. While I said I am easygoing and I don't care too much about most little things around me, the one thing I do care about is cleanliness. So as my future roommate, I would appreciate your cooperation in keeping our living space clean! I would describe my personality and personality traits additionally as being silly and humorous, self aware, and intelligent, if that can be considered a personality trait. Historically over my life, smart and funny are the two positive traits I have heard from friends the most and I am happy that is the case. However since I am reserved, these traits are mostly only shared with my close friends so they are the ones who know that about my personality ( and know you). To even it out and discuss potentail negatives, because of my homebody nature and somewhat akin to it, I can be pretty lazy. In addition because I have had an easy time through school and such in my life due to my natural intellect, I can be a little egotistical about my intelligence and also do not study much (but still do well). I hope you can tolerate this! \n\n\n\n",

        "negative_text": "Well I did add on some negatives at the end there. I can extrapolate about them further. I can be lazy because I like to do activities at home and this can make me too complacent at times where I don't go out and try new things enough. This is also related to my natural smarts where I can coast through class and work because I don't have to work hard to perform well in these things. This overall lazy and complacent theme is something I do try to work on, and also something I value in the people around me for helping me with. They can help get me out of my shell to do new things, and also to be a little more ambitious and use my talents. Another negative thing I talked about was my egotism in relation to intelligence. While I think that I do not brag about this to other people outwardly, on the inside I do feel intellectually superior to most people and this is something the people closest to me are aware of. While I don't try to fight this too much, I do try and usually succeed at keeping this from appearing in my everyday life and minimizing its impact as much as possible. Overall though, I do feel okay having this attitude to some degree. One other thing I could point to being negative is that I would consider myself a little more selfish than the average person in the way that I care less about people I do not know well than others. This fits in line with my interest in having a few close friends rather than many friends; I have a hard time caring much about that many people I guess. "

        "text": "I consider myself to be pretty smart and hard-working (though recently, I have some trouble getting started on assignments). I sleep a lot (arguably, slightly more than needed) but I can also pull all nighters when needed. I don't get much physical activity in - I am kind of a couch potato (but I do want to lose weight and start becoming more active). I try to keep everything clean, beautiful, and organized but that doesn't always happen as things get busy. I talk to my family a lot as they are very important to me. I don't have many super close friends but I try to hang out with at least one person every week. \nBeing ambitious, dedicated, and goal-driven is highly important to me. I wish to be very successful and rich in life and make my parents proud. I am not very emotional in public so I tend to cry a lot and let out all my emotions when I am in my own private space. Growing up, I was considered a little selfish and arrogant but since then being nice and humble are both very important to me so those are traits I am actively working on.\nIm in the stage of my life where I am trying to figure out my morals and my identity. I am pretty religious for my age and my religion is very important to me. Earlier, everything used to be very black and white but now I am questioning everything and it is hard to even categorize the extremes as right or wrong. This is something I am working on and hoping to have figured out soon.\nBeing respectful, open minded (non judgmental), and nice are important to me. I also don't want to be too loud or always be involved in drama. Since I am questioning many things right now I tend to give people a huge margin. I am not in a relationship because it has been very taboo. I am very conflicted about this because logically speaking, I don't want one however, I am also sort of a hopeless romantic. I think I need to cross a few barriers before I can actively start looking for a relationship: lose weight, and gain my parents' approval to start looking for a partner.\nMy favorite activities are mostly just watching TV or keep working / looking for opportunities. I love learning new languages. There are many things I want to learn / that are on my to-do list that I haven't gotten to yet, but the top ones are: learning horse riding, learning more bhajans (devotional songs), learning crocheting, mastering the languages I already know and then learning Urdu script and then learning an additional language, learning Kathak, etc. I do however want to get into law school and kind of set my career up before I delve into my other interests.\nI want to be liked and praised by others. I have a lot of issues with my high school years and now struggle to choose between wanting to be well known and wanting to just live a peaceful life. Moreover, I have always been very decisive up until recently when I decided to give up pre med and since then making decisions has been hard of me. With so many core aspects of me changing as I actively try to improve myself, it is difficult establishing an identity. I also feel like I don't necessarily have a home right now since dorms don't count and I don't live with my family all year so it feels weird. I would like to have a home one day,\nAnother thing that is extremely important to me is being independent. I think I have made pretty good progress on this since I handle most things on my own. Here are some things that I think can help me become more independent: learning how to drive, learning cooking and becoming financially independent.",

I can be stubborn at times. I can procrastinate on a lot of work. I am a little afraid of failure. Once I make up my mind about something being right or wrong, I stick to it and often times I want other people to conform to that if it is like an action more than just an opinion. I can be very lazy, kind of goes along with the procrastination. Somethings really irritate me that don't irritate many people - saying certain phrases or hearing certain noises. I like to be left alone and when people don't interfere in my business or comment on my personal habits, especially when I am busy. I have a tendency to gravitate towards unhealthy food choices. I sometimes think I am better than others (really trying not to). I don't always care about the smaller details when it comes to others. I can be very involved in myself. I pretend that I don't love but I do and I don't know which of the two is worse."

I hold the gym dear to my heart, as it's the place that brings me peace and joy. I grew up with sisters and have a heart of a mother and can be a bit sensitive sometimes. I can be lazy when the weather is right. I also love nature and books and find myself lost in the world of fiction. I recently bought a motorcycle and fell in love with the wind. At times it makes me feel like a bird and a bit more free. I think I've become a bit more shy as school transitioned to online as I a had little to no contact with meeting new people. That makes me a bit sad sometimes because I used to love being able to meet new friends but now it's a bit hard. I am an empath and can sometimes easily find myself helping others in need.

My drive to be better causes me to lose patience with people who are acting thoughtlessly or carelessly, but in most other situations I can be very patient. I tend to be introverted more than extroverted, and conscientious rather than carefree. I try to strive towards ideals, but I have a very realist view of the world. I have a pretty low opinion of the average person, and I see a lot of people making mistakes or foolish or selfish decisions that to me seem almost effortless to avoid. I don't like my world very much, so I want to change it for the better, but I get stressed and depressed worrying that it won't be possible. I do think there are great people out there, but there aren't many of them and their environment deprives them of the chance to realize their potential.

I make jokes all the time but sometimes I stay quiet because I get the social queue that my joke isn't appropriate at that time. I like to read people before I socialize with them, I'm not shy I'm just waiting until we get to know each other a little bit more. I'm a huge nerd (also make fun of these things too). I watch anime, comic movies, watch programming/math videos for fun ironically. I enjoy going to the gym. Really like going but I'm not too intense to care about my diet. I lose track of time all the time and want to do everything. Sometimes that everything gets in the way of time. I don't think a lot sometimes. Like I like to live in the moment and not think but sometimes that has its consequences. I struggle paying attention. I don't like to learn when I don't want to lean. I like when everything is laid out rather than neatly organized. I get distracted a lot, like just rn. I go on tangents all the time. I don't mind people's opinions about serious topics, I just don't like if they were to project it onto me. I try not to generalize. Talkign is hard, I can't speak in full sentences. Spelling is hard. I sometimes act differently in different groups/environments. My hobbies fluctuate. Overaly ambitious. Like music out loud.",

I do not usually get upset or mad at people, but when I do I become very distant by ignoring their existence in my life. I usually ignore someone for around 1-2 weeks and begin to talk to someone again to works things out if I truly thing they should still be my friend. This trait had lead me to lose some friends because I had gotten into the mindset that they did not mean much in my life, therefore they should not be apart of my life anymore. Last year I had some times where I was going through dark times and I would just like to isolate myself as well because I believed I should not be around people when I am not in a good mood. In that way, I choose to isolate myself from others once again. This does not happen often, but it happens enough where I do realize these are concerning traits I have. "

I've been told I am funny without knowing that I am funny, my statements might take people by surprise which is why they laugh. I am also nice and sensitive. I feel other's pain and don't like to see people I care about being upset. If I don't like you you will know, even though I am not rude enough to tell you that to your face. If I do like you you will know because I most likely will tell you that. I am appreciative and grateful even though it is not easily apparent by the way I speak and act. I appreciate people more than I appreciate the world and I am not difficult to make happy. I am always anxious all the time. I have a depressive personality. I am ambitious and my anxiety does little to stop me from taking on new tasks, however, once I start a new task I become my biggest critic. I am a bully to myself, which stems from the criticism I feel I get from others around me. I overthink a lot, and I tend to assume the worst from people when it involves me. I try to be happy, and this can come off as strange bursts of euphoria at times. I can be reckless and free spirited to the point that its unhelpful to my wellbeing but sometimes I put happiness over safety. I am caring, and will listen to your complaints and silently judge you but in the nicest way possible. I am not perfect and I am able to accept that, but I am also aware that no one is realistically perfect and I am content with having a perfectly imperfect relationship. I laugh a lot and try not to take things too seriously. I joke about any inconveniences in my life and I welcome others to joke with me. ",

I can be judgmental and make unfair assumptions about people based on negative first impressions. I get frustrated when people are slow or don't see things the same way I do. I live in my head most of the time which can make it hard for me to accept reality. On a nicer note, because I think I've been pretty mean to myself so far, I am good at giving people advice and try to let others know that they are worth more than they think.

I also love reading and writing about nature and what it means to be a human being and the complexities of our existence and the simplicities of our lives. I love working with kids and taking care of people. I try to be a good listener, but I do talk a lot and my mind is constantly racing with new ideas and random thoughts so I try to balance my talking and listening in a conversation. I love to bake, but in all honesty, I am more of a stress baker than a baker who does it when I feel at ease. I guess it would be fair to say I'm a little stubborn and bossy, but I just like getting things done. I'm the oldest and only sister in my family so I am good at managing things and balancing responsibilities. Sometimes a wee bit of a control freak and \"Type A,\" but I like to take my time and enjoy life too. I like taking pictures and capturing precious memories. Although I am a bit of a hoarder when it comes to letters and pictures, but at least I am a sentimental hoarder. If I'm comfortable with you, I'll probably be very silly and a little dumb because I usually try my best to express myself as eloquently as I can/I can seem more put-together when we aren't close, but I am as messy and human as anyone else. I like listening to music and singing, but I can be a little shy when it comes to performing in front of others who I am nervous around/intimidated by. When I'm comfortable, I love to perform and entertain the people around me. ",

I can be moody sometimes. When I'm stressed, it can become everyone's problem (but I really try not to worry people or take things out on them) because my mood can be so negative. I have a hard time asking for help and don't love being uncomfortable even if it's for my greater good. Sometimes, I would rather suffer alone than make someone else have to be there for me. I can be judgmental, but I do try to give people grace. Some of my friends say I give people too much grace, but I think everyone deserves a chance or two because we all make mistakes. When I'm mad, I am someone I don't want to be around, but many of my friends think it's equally entertaining and scary to see me legitimately angry at someone or something since it doesn't happen so often. I get upset easily, but anger is not an emotion I show people who I am not close to and it feels almost like a special occasion so it feels more intense than emotions I feel more regularly like joy and contentment. I can be lazy and disorganized and hypocritical and easily irritated. I hate redundancy and when people lack common sense and aren't considerate to the people around them."

I also tend to snap or get frustrated easily if I am overstimulated which is quite often. I have gotten better at it, but I would still consider this to be an issue. im also in my own head a lot and tend to overthink even the smallest things that happen to me. I grew up in a toxic environment at home, so I have a lot of tendencies that ive picked up from my parents that I notice carry onto my personal relationships in adulthood. I like stability and routine, and when things don't go the way I anticipated and prated in my head, I get upset even if the change is seemingly small to others. I have little patience for people without common sense and I hate repeating myself. sometimes I forget to catch myself before I speak and I ask personal questions that can be uncomfortable to others.

        "text": "Hi, my name is Maya and I can definitely say that I am someone who just likes to be around positive energy. I am naturally a very introverted person, but I love meeting new people. I am very kind to those I meet and am an empath. I would rather stay in and watch a movie or go out to dinner rather than party at a frat or go to the bars/clubs. I am down for pretty much anything, but I do like to have a heads up before anything. I like to stick to my own schedule and when I have plans, I do not like the defer from them. I am extremely open-minded when meeting people, I love to learn about new cultures and dynamics that individuals have. I also like to learn about how someone's traits may clash or compliment mine. In the past, I have been told that I can be too nice to people and in turn, they take advantage of me but the way that I see it, if I am being nice and giving my all to everyone I meet, I cannot get upset because I don't do those actions for them, I do it for myself. I think that being gracious and having gratitude when meeting other people in life is so important. It is always good to form an opinion on someone based on your personal experience with them and not the comments from others. I come from a very tight-knit family so I understand the importance of maintaining healthy relationships in my life. I see my mom's sister's family almost every single day and I would do absolutely anything for them. I look up to my older cousins for how they treat strangers with open arms and are so generous. They are all my siblings in my mind and I aspire to be like them when I get older and have kids of my own. \nIn terms of other activities, I LOVE watching tv shows and movies. I am currently working my way through Naruto for the first time even though I used to be super skeptical about watching anime's. But so far, I absolutely love it. I have a major passion for music. I actually used to be a music major before transferring to Berkeley. I love to make music and sing my heart out, but only when no one is watching lol. I am also the biggest foodie you might ever meet. With my Filipina background, it is almost impossible for me to find a food that I refuse to try. I love learning about other culture's foods and trying out all the food I can. I also have been trying to get into working out recently, but it's been hard finding the motivation to keep going. I have horrible body image. Anyway, I hope this gives you a good jist of who I may be as a person. Thanks for listening!",

I really love spending time with the people closest to me and just talking to them about absolutely anything.

Sometimes I draw, but I don't feel committed enough to it to really call it a hobby.  When I do something I put my all into it, and anything less than that means I don't really percieve it as part of my interests or smthn. I'm a good listener, though sometimes I think i come off as apathetic. I care a lot about other people's feelings when I'm interacting with them; I'm senstive to rejection (isnt everyone) bbut I'm trying to work on that. I am under no illusion thinking im funny, but I like to laugh and make bad (dad) jokes. I like reading. I always want to complete at least my portion of work in any circumstance, though sometimes I feel to tired to complete anything more.. I wish I was more helpful. I'm really shy around strangers, unless I'm in a setting where I know how to act around others (really I think I just have social anxiety, I just don't bother getting diagnosed). Oh, I really like patterns; I'm pattern oriented. I also am really competitive, not in a way that I'm trying to win, but I'm going to give it my all. My mom's always told me Im compassionate and kind but I think she just says that because I'm her kid, though I do try to be haha. I actually really like talking with people, but not for extended amounts of time. If im going to be in a conversation I'd rather be the center of attention, unless I'm tired or if I'm observing in a fun way. I don't think my traits are always all that constant, though.",

I often have trouble expressing myself as well as being direct with people which is something I would like to improve on. I am generally pretty happy but it can occasionally be easy for me to become down as a result of something which happened during the day. When this happens I usually find it pretty difficult to switch emotions and these emotions will often stick around for a couple days. My favorite activities include things like watching movies and playing games with friends. That being said sometimes I need alone time and appreciate being given it. I also feel like I am oftentimes more anxious and stressed out than I should be and would like to figure out a way to alleviate these feelings.",

There are things that I have always thought to be true about myself that perhaps no longer are.\nI have always been so sure of myself, and so confident in recent years that things will be Okay.  Now, I am very worried about the state of our world, as well as my ability to accomplish all I have set out to be.  Not being arrogant is a new feeling for me.  I'm not sure I like it.\nI am quieter than I used to be.  I am better at active listening.  I get drained more easily when I spend time with groups of people.\nI feel myself being dictated to by my emotions.  I try to rationalize them, to do what reason says is the smart thing to do, and it's harder than it has been in the past.  I am panicky, I am overwhelmed, and making lists that show how much I have to do just aren't cutting it.\n\nSome other things about me:\nI have less patience than I should have for people who I view as less competent than I am.\nI am a freak for religion and for history\nI am also a freak for keeping things clean.\nI donate to charity regularly - time and money -, but maybe I do it more to assuage my own guilt about my privilege than to actually do good.  I don't think that's true, but the thought that I am secretly not a Generous or Good person keeps me up at night.\n\nThis isn't the assignment, but I hope it's okay.  ",

I tend to form judgements about people very quickly, and while these judgements are somewhat malleable I tend to be a victim of confirmation bias when it comes to labeling people as \"friend\" or \"not friend.\" That is to say, once I've formed a first impression about a person, my idea of who they are is unlikely to change quickly. I promise that I'm fun most of the time, though; I get a lot of laughs out of people and love to play practical jokes. I certainly can be polarizing, as I have a strong personality. I'm rambunctious and goofy, but also can get fierce when I feel like I'm competing with someone -- whether that's in a classroom, on a basketball court, or elsewhere. Some people find my tenacity to be motivating, but I can see where it would be off-putting. Oh, I also think of myself as pensive. I try to think critically about existential issues and sometimes people find things that I say to be profound. Perhaps it's evident from that last statement that I'm not the most humble individual, but that's something that I'm working on. In short, I'm a bit of a paradox.

It's perhaps a bit trite to say this, but I'm the type of person who will put others above myself -- when I deem them worthy of my loyalty. I've hosted parties at my own house, volunteered to be a designated driver, and taken inebriated friends from my house to their own, only to turn around and drive back to my place late in the night. That's not an incredible sacrifice, I'm sure that there are examples of greater magnitude that I could think up given more time, but I can't think of another person in my friend group who's done that. I also left out the fact that I strive to be a role model for my younger sisters, leading by example in school, with how I treat people, and in other domains. I see that this was asking for \"perhaps more negative\" facets of me, but I feel like I figuratively threw myself under the bus in the last section so I wanted to balance things out. I think I left out my better traits in the previous exercise."

I believe I am adventurous because I am always looking for something new to do and am always open to many new opportunities no matter how out of the way they are for me. I also am always going on random midday adventures and sort of allow myself to not have a repeating schedule that way every day can feel new. I believe I am calm as I actively use breathing techniques when I get into stressful situations as to prevent myself from getting overwhelmed. I also do these exercises to keep myself from getting irrationally angry as I enjoy communicating out issues and trying to resolve things in a productive manner. Lastly I believe I am kind as most of the things I do are for other people. I always go out of my way to help people and want to provide therapy for free in the future for people in my town as a way of giving back to my community. I would describe my feelings as a generally happy individual who always tries to see the good in every day. I always treat each day as a new day in order to avoid carrying lots of anguish and sadness inside. When I do get overwhelmed with sadness or anger I try to calm down by either crying or letting my frustrations out and talking to those who I love the most. My favorite activities consist of playing videogames, hanging out with my friends, and living life to the fullest by doing random things everyday. ",

I am a clean freak so when things get messy or stay messy for longer than a week then I begin to ask people to pick up the slack and clean with them. I am also very forgetful about important things which leads to me forgetting about promises I make with people. I always intend to keep them but I struggle to remember everything that happens in my day-to-day life. I sometimes feel like I deserve to be treated better by people because I do kind things and I had a hard life and if I think about it too much it puts me in a funk and makes me feel worse about myself. I constantly struggle to maintain a balance between feeling good because I help people and feeling bad because I wish more people recognized my good and respected me for it. I also do not take criticism very well. I used to be worse at it but I try to take people's word with good intentions but it always makes me feel subpar to them. It makes me feel like I am not as good as everyone else and I never will be."

On the most part, if I don't value the relationship, then I don't really have standards and will let those people do what they wish. I am actively working and trying to improve my communication when it comes to those relationships that matter. I have troubles with expectations because I believe so fiercely in the good and kindness of other people. I am a people pleaser and sometimes sacrifice my own well being for the will and wants of others. I wear my heart on my sleeve and cry easily. I am not afraid to share how I feel or tell someone how I feel. When I am emotionally exhausted, I will not appease people and will say what I want instead of what they want. But I am always there for someone who needs to be heard or someone who is going through a rough time. I think a lot of my faults lie in the fact that I want to help people so bad that I forget myself. I am constantly learning and trying to make room for growth in myself. I am always open to constructive criticism. I hold very strong to my standards, which are no hard to appease, but when lines are crossed, I cannot allow it.

Some things that I left out, though, are that I have depression and a lot of my life has been hard, making it so that I had to grow up when I was a lot younger. I am still dealing with those residual issues with boundaries, communication, and acceptance. My book stays closed for certain things I deem necessary. I think a lot of that has to do with how I want to portray myself. I want to humanize myself and accentuate flaws, but also include that I am a work in progress, just like everyone else. I don't want to divulge exactly how MUCH work has yet to be done. I hold a lot in and do not like confrontation, especially if I would have to confront someone's main personality trait.

However, I can be very petty if someone is able to set me off and have no problems just not being friends with people because there are many other people more worthy of my time. I really like cooking and I think it is my favorite hobby besides sleeping. I also enjoy telling people random facts I learn usually scientific. However, I am a very bad procrastinator and will often calculate how long something will take me and then wait until theres that much time left before the deadline. I like feeding people and am always down to hangout. My friends will just ask to randomly come over and I usually say yes even if I am not home, because I would not be friends with someone I trust. I am very blunt and am very straight up with my thoughts and feelings about people, but i am also always ready to confront someone if they are doing something I don't like or disagree with. I would say I am very easygoing and get annoyed in the moment but get over it quickly even if I complain a lot. One way I like to hangout with people is exploring different areas by walking around, going in shops, eating food etc. I also really like thrifting because I like buying new clothes, but I am broke so I buy them for cheap. I also try to be environmentally conscious by reusing these clothes instead of buying new ones as much as possible. The closer I am to people the more I like harassing and bullying them. Not in a serious way, but more joking around and occassionally saying out of pocket things, within reason of course nothing hurtful. Im pretty bad with sincere compliments on things I don't usually get complimented in. Like if someone tells me i am a good cook then that doesn't do anything because I know that already, but something like saying Im looking good or I'm kind gets me embarrassed. ",

Depending on the situation I can be introverted or extroverted. I love watching movies and TV shows. I like window shopping but not really the spending money part.

When I have opinions, I hold on to them tightly, but I love to keep an open mind. I'm often times the mediator in my family because I try to listen to everyone and I try my best to understand others. I love when I am heard, so I try to be a good listener. I'm confident at times but I can get a bit insecure about myself. I compare myself a lot to others. Its a bad habit of mine. Because of this personality trait, it kind of makes it hard for me to make new friends because I just look down on myself. Its strange though because sometimes I just feel good about myself. Oh also, I am a girly girl. I love the color pink, I love being a girl. I love doing my own nails, getting ready to do my hair, doing my makeup. I love all that. ",

I hold on to my opinions and I like to be right. Oh another thing is that I am competitive.

This doesn't mix well with my competitiveness because I often find myself even competing with the people I love. I sometimes worry that I act like a know-it-all.

I tend to be quiet around environments that are new to me or when meeting a lot of new people but as I get to know one another and become more comfortable, I tend to become more talkative. Although I can be extraverted at times, I think I'm more of an introvert. My favorite things to do are going on food trips with my close friends and going to art museums and exhibits. I'm really interested in architectural design and modern, contemporary art. \n\nI'm usually open to trying out new things at times, meeting new people, and being adventurous with traveling. In my daily life, I like to create agendas and stick to the schedule as much as I can. As far as my habits at home, I tend to keep my space pretty clean and tidy and organized by sections and folders. \n\nI tend to feel calm most times as I value things that are more consistent without much fluctuations. I rarely ever get upset although I can get stressed easily from academics and other things in life. I try to mediate my stress through yoga and tennis which are my top two favorite things to do on the weekends. Lastly, I have a huge heart for dogs!! One day I hope to have them as part of my family :)",

However, I love getting to know people, and I would say that I generally enjoy talking to strangers. Many acquaintances and even close friends describe me as seemingly extroverted because I'm willing to put myself out there. Although I always get a little nervous in many social situations, I like to do this because I think talking to people and getting to know others/hearing their stories is what makes life meaningful. I find that human connections is one of the driving forces being my decisions and goals in life. I'm also a very emotional person, but it takes me a long time to begin trusting someone before divulging and confiding in them. It's nothing personal against any individual, but I have always been a fairly independent person. I have difficulties asking for help, and it's something that I think I'm becoming better at gradually. I don't like to make generic small talk, but I am generally seeking deeper conversations (that being said, I am often silly and goofy with my friends). I can be a cynical and pessimistic person, but more in the sense that I'm realistic about what the worst scenario is. I'm much harder on myself than I am on other people. I love deeply, and when I decide to trust someone, it's because I see them as (hopefully) being in my life for the long term. It takes me a long time to develop feelings (romantically), but once I do, I don't see myself getting over said feelings anytime soon. I feel emotions very strongly, but it's not always obvious to others. I generally see the best in people until proven otherwise, but I think some of my interactions in life have made me less optimistic about people's intentions. I would describe myself as a warm person in that I am generally friendly and welcoming towards anyone I interact with; however, if that energy is not reciprocated over time, I will be more neutral in my interactions with someone. I care deeply about those close to me, and if someone hurt the people important to me, I would be more than willing to take action and speak up for them. However, I am more hesitant to do the same for myself. I think in some ways, although I wouldn't say I lack self-confidence, I do view others as almost more \"deserving\" than me. I also like to keep myself busy; I say it's because I want to make the most out of life, but I think part of it comes from a fear that I'm never doing enough. Anything I do in life is because I want to do it; if I don't enjoy it, I will not stay just because it'll benefit my future professional goals. I hope to leave an impact on at least one person in my life.",

In recent years, I think I've become much better at managing my emotions.

I feel like I can't function unless everything is clean. I can't focus unless I'm in a clean environment. I very type-A and like things done a very specific way. I try to not be anal about it but I like to do things myself so they're done exactly how I want it. Not a good trait, but most of my friends are used to it and actually like that they don't have to do anything because I'll do it myself. I consider me being a dog person a personality trait. My dog, Chewie, is my favorite person. I talk about him more than I probably should. I would consider myself an ambivert. I love being with friends, but I also very desperately need alone time. I don't have a big social battery and will get cranky if I'm constantly surrounded by people. I've become much more social since coming to college, but still really value alone time to recharge my batteries. I sometimes think I'm an emotional person, but not in the traditional sense (if that makes any sense). I get emotional abt stupid things. Like I will cry over a minor inconvenience, but not something that is actually bothering me or hurt my feelings. When it's something serious I'm more of the type to shut down and not feel it. But during day to day things I will cry or get upset over stupid things like not finding the right pair of socks. I also don't handle other people's emotions well. I am not the person to go to when you're crying. I get awkward and don't know what to do. I'm not a very comforting touchy feely person. I have a lot of friends whose love language is personal touch when I'm someone who is not s hugger or any of that. I feel like I'm more of a showing love through actions and gift giving. I don't like to talk about how I'm feeling and am not big on doing that w others so I usually show appreciation and love through little gifts and personal time together. ",

A negative part of my personality that I have been trying to fix for years is getting upset easily. I have learned overtime to leave or avoid situations when I'm upset bc I will say things that I do not mean. It bothers ppl bc when I'm mad I shut down and leave the room. I know myself well enough that I do not want to stay and speak without having time to work through my thoughts. I also consider myself a jealous person. I have been since I was little. I'm not sure why but I spend way too much time comparing myself to other people. It's another thing I've tried to work on but have not been as successful at getting rid of. I also sometimes consider myself being a ppl pleaser as a negative. I often put ppl above myself and make myself unhappy in the process. I never want to hurt anyones feelings so I end up hurting myself instead. Overtime I have gotten better at prioritizing me but them sometimes I feel like I bad friends. I'm still trying to find a good balance of taking care of myself but still being there for other people. I also think I'm sometimes a hard person in the sense that I don't let people in easily. People often think I don't like them when I actually do I'm just not good at expressing myself and making new friends. "

I am a generally introverted person in that I enjoy having my own time to recharge and enjoy spending time alone, but my close relationships are also one of the most important things to me. I love to spend time with friends and close family members, and building these relationships is a major goal of mine. I would say that I am conscientious, detail-oriented, and can be a perfectionist, known as the \"type A\" person, though I think the extent of this depends on who I am around. I can also find myself being more laid back and carefree when around people I am very comfortable with. I like to be efficient, get things done, and then have time to relax and recharge as I see fit during the day.",

        "negative_text": "One negative thing about my personality is that I feel like I can have a high level of anxiety or perhaps neuroticism when I get in an irritated mood, and can be very specific and detail-oriented about things, so when things don't go as well, these levels can increase. I think that I also have the tendency to be hot and cold with certain people, which is a reaction to protecting myself and my own feelings, especially when I still need to process how I feel inside before expressing that view to the other person. I think this stems from what I believe to be my fearful avoidant attachment style that results from my experience during childhood with my parents in having to protect my emotions while others are acting inconsistently around me, which causes me to act inconsistently myself. I also think an important part of my personality is that, while personality is a stable thing, different facets of my personality wane and wax across time as I grow up and learn more about myself."

I find that being straightforward (not to the point of being unnecessarily rude) makes for the most productive and functional environments. I believe that my being a huge overthinker greatly contributes to this mentality of mine. It's very important to me that the people around me reciprocate how I encourage people to communicate their feelings to me without worrying about my reaction. I believe that this dynamic is very important in all situations, but especially in one where we are sharing our space. In terms of my demeanor, I am a pretty outgoing and lighthearted person when I am feeling comfortable in my surroundings. However, I have a pretty low social battery sometimes and just need particular people or alone time to recuperate. As for my interests, I love playing sports and reading. I also believe that I am a pretty articulate and curious person. Nothing makes me feel closer to a person than being able to talk about anything and everything with a person while easing into comfortable silence along the way. Throughout all of this, I like to think that I employ a pretty good chaotic and witty sense of humor on a day-to-day basis in the appropriate environment of course. In terms of my priorities, I think I am pretty disciplined when it comes to academics and self-care. I tend to value objects based more on sentimentality than market value.",

I believe that because I intentionally try to go out of my way to welcome others, keep communal spaces clean, and always make sure to check in with others and how they are feeling. I consider myself a loyal friend, daughter, and sister. I always aim to be there for my friends and family, as they are important to me, and I love making them laugh. I'm a huge fan of comedy and anything that's remotely funny; I think I like to bring joy to others, and I do my best job in trying to make myself and others laugh. In terms of my lifestyle, I like to enjoy myself and indulge in the occasional college party, but more as a way to be an unhinged college student. I also tend to stress out over the smallest things, and I try to make things as perfect as possible the first time around, or I probably won't try doing it again. I am quite a forgetful person, so I try to make calendar events for things or write things down as a way to remember. I enjoy keeping to myself, and I like my alone time; however, too much alone time will end up in me ruminating in my own thoughts. I prefer to keep things neat and clean, as I am a slight germaphobe, but after studying abroad, I've learned to tackle my fear of germs in new ways (or even lessen my fear of it). I would like to emphasize \"slight\" because there are many things that most germaphobes do that I don't, I just have a greater affinity for keeping things neat, clean, and sanitary. I don't really have a great sense of fashion, but that's something I'm working on. I think clothing is a huge extension of personality, and I try to keep my palette quite neutral with earthy tones. If I were to be a color, I would be a dark forest green. Not only because dark forest greens are my favorite colors, but I think they represent my personality quite well. Paired with golden tones, I can be very warm, bright, and inviting. Paired with other neutral tones (like brown, beige, and other greens), I can be very cool, calm, and collected (despite struggling with social anxiety). \n\n\n",

However, I am quite a non-confrontational, passive-aggressive person. If things don't go my way or if I'm upset, there's a good chance that the other person will not know, but all my friends will. I try not to talk poorly behind people's backs, but I know I do that on the occasion when I'm having a \"hard time\" navigating through issues in relationships like friends and family. Another negative thing about my personality is that I tend to care about looks a bit more\u2014but I hold others to the same standard as I hold for myself. \n"

I love traveling and dream of going everywhere in the world, but sometimes get overwhelmed when I realize I will never truly see everything the world has to offer. I tend to be pretty stubborn, and have a hard time admitting when I am wrong. People who know me would probably describe me as quick-witted, and my brain works pretty fast. I am an extremely curious person, and often seek the answers to questions that I have, big or small. I also tend to be quite intuitive, and am pretty in touch with my emotions. On the topic of emotions, I am a very emotional person. I cry very eaSily, like when I see a person eating dinner alone, or a sad clip of a movie.

I'm hard of hearing so I will probably ask you to repeat yourself a lot, so maybe slow down and speak louder when you're speaking with me. I'm super nice and respectful. I'm generally quiet and I usually don't start the conversation. But once a conversation is going, I always make sure that I'm attentive and showing interest in whatever you're saying. I don't show much emotions to people - the most I'll show is happiness (laughing and smiling). If I'm mad or upset about something you did or said, I'm most likely not going to say anything to you in person. I might say something later on through text, however. When I'm doing work, I've learned that I need boundaries so I don't like it when I'm disturbed by some irrelevant/unnecessary talk. BUUUUT I'm also funny. Like I said, once I get comfortable with you, I'll start being myself more. I'm friendly and sometimes I'm the first one to approach a new person to start making new friends. I also curse a lot but in a fun way, not in any harmful way. I'm always down for something outdoorsy like hiking and I like working out at the gym. I think I like working out alone though. If you also have boundaries, I'll respect them. I'm a clean person outside of my own room (kitchen, living room, bathroom), but I can get messy and unorganized sometimes in my own personal space.

I hate to share. Maybe it is because I am an only child. Who knows. Every moment of my life is filled with music. I like to have a soundtrack to my life. It can be such an accurate erepresenattion of a mood, or It can change the mood completely. It is necessary. I am messy, but in a controlled kind of way. I have ADHD, which is something that I also feel is a strong part of my identity. I am hyper in a talking kind of way, and I distracted often. I am mostly just excited about a lot of things. Although I think I probably look like I am not excited often. I am joking most of the time, and it is hard for people to tell whether I am being serious or not. I love my friends so much. So much. Sitting and having coffee and catching up is an ideal way to spend time for me. I am very open, and not many things are off limits for me to talk about to a stranger. At night, I love to dance. I will dance all night until forced to leave. Going out at night is where a lot of my energy comes from. I had two fish, but one of them just passed away. This was a huge loss for me. He was one of my best friends. When I thought of him, it was like recalling a friend.",

At Berkeley, I never feel like I am up to par. I can't remember things and get down on myself. School is hard for me. When COVID hit, my friends left and I couldn't go out anymore. School went online and I was left with nothing that made me happy. I got very depressed. When I was depressed I would lay on the couch crying for entire days. I would not be fun to talk to because I was easily agitated. I cried at dinner tables. I cried in my room. I cried and cried and cried. \nI am stubborn. I hold grudges like no one else I know. If you cross me, you will never uncross me. I make self deprecating dad jokes because my father left when I was a kid. Sometimes people don't know how to react to these. When I am obsessed with something, it occupies my mind and I talk about whatever niche that is to whoever is around. They also don't know to react to this."

I am hardworking and diligent therefore my time for those things are important to me and I like to have a quiet and clean space when I am working. I can be loud when I have to call my family. I don't often hear myself getting loud so Ill just start yelling and laughing. However if you tell me to quiet down I will listen and I am open to feedback and compromising on things if needed. I can definitely talk things out and appreciate talking about stuff such as when people are coming over or when we need a specific room for guests/ activities. I like things such as chores to be fair and I would appreciate everyone switching things around once and awhile. I am particular about my stuff so losing stuff or taking things without asking does bother me. I can share my things with others but as long as its returned in the same way. I can also get bothered when there is poor communication about an issue. Open communication is really important for me. However, if something bothers me sometimes I wont say anything to avoid conflict. I am scared of confrontation and sometimes I wont say anything even if its standing up for my needs or comfort. Generally I stay at home and only like to be out during the day. I go to sleep early and wake up early. I am focused on my priorities and generally dont like when plans get in the way of stuff Ive already planned out. ",

I really like traveling, even though I can\u2019t travel very often due to school an finances. I would like to think that I work really hard, sometimes I can be a bit lazy and procrastinate things, but overall I have a lot of ambition for my life and will work hard to achieve those goals. I really love children, I think they\u2019re so cute and funny, bit also smarter than a lot of people give them credit for. I tend to overthink things a little bit and get into my own head, especially when I have a lot going on or I\u2019m stressed. I really enjoy singing, I\u2019ve been singing since I could talk. I sing pretty often to music or just little tunes while I\u2019m walking around or getting ready. My music taste varies quite a bit, I listen to pop, rock, country, r&b, Disney, a little bit of rap, show tunes. I\u2019m just not a fan of EDM, and most rap. I also really love Italy, I studied abroad there and desperately want to go back. I\u2019m trying to learn Italian, but it is a lot harder when I\u2019m not immersed in the language. I also love dogs. A lot of people have described me as having golden retriever energy, or Labrador energy. But I love playing with dogs and cuddling with them. I don\u2019t have a dog myself, but I typically get very attached to my friends\u2019 dogs. I do really want a dog, when I graduate I\u2019m planning to adopt a dog since I\u2019ve always wanted one. I also love the water, being in pools, by the beach, lakes, anything like that. I\u2019ve noticed I will get a bit sad if I go a long time without being near the water.",

I\u2019m very protective of the people that I love, probably too much. Once I form an opinion of someone, it is pretty difficult to change my mind. I also occasionally have panic attacks, usually when I\u2019;m going through something particularly difficult, but a lot of the time I feel like I\u2019m overreacting. I am also pretty gullible and I think people try to take advantage of that to manipulate me, but I\u2019m so afraid of making people mad at me that I usually go along with it until its too late. "

I think I am typically a go-with-the-flow type of person and won't usually try to control plans or impose my thoughts/ feelings into situations that involve other people. This is probably attributable to the fact that i'm pretty non-confrontational and don't like to start/ engage in conflict even when it might be necessary. I mostly enjoy activities that involve a small group of people like hiking or going to the beach so that I can be social but also have one on one time with people that I want to talk to more deeply. I am a little disorganized (both in my room and thoughts) but can focus on my tasks well under a time crunch or when they are very important. I can get really invested in conversations about things i am passionate about or find interesting, and one of my favorite things to do with other people is get down rabbit holes of random topics. When i'm bored, I like to spend my free time listening to music or doing creative activities like drawing and crocheting ",

When problems come up I do prefer direct communication to work out the problem as quickly as possible, and can get easily irritated if others don't do the same and the problem persists.

To be honest, my problem solving capabilities are pretty good and I am generally an ok/good leader, but I do not like to be one and prefer to stay as a background worker.

Between banter I could become satisfied with sitting outside in stillness. Basking in the outside with no need to add anything to the sounds that already exist. I think that insecurity means that I search for validation in conversations and recognition, or even listening (I don't feel very listened to often). When I am listened to I think I can talk too much. Weave a conversation around myself, with myself as moderator and topic changer. I think that this is a remnant of covid society, where I had nobody to talk to for months. \n\nI am judgy towards people for various irrational reasons. This is something I need to fix but it feels like my unconscious mind picks apart any new person and labels them as unacceptable as soon as they reveal something not agreeable to me. Not that they aren't a good person but because I hold some sort of fallacy that I need to share the same music, habits, hobbies, as someone to be friends with them. My high school friends have shown that this isn't true. I think I have found that shared hobbies, music, are a proxy to a good friendship but not a requirement, necessarily.",

I am often convinced that I can't be friends with people who don't share every part of their hobbies or selves with me which isn't true at all.\n\nI am also a downer sometimes. If my social battery runs out, if I'm tired, hungry, especially if I'm alread the center of attention, as I described in the previous part, I will bring the morale of an entire group down with me. Rather than accepting that I'm just down with social interaction, I will often convince myself that my friends dislike me and pick out their negative traits and tell myself something like \"I shouldn't see these people again\". I don't think I'm too self-righteous. I know there's a lot of things wrong with me, but I worry and know that I'm too critical of others. I'm often the one to cut off a friendship, end a relationship, cancel a date. And because of that I have few friends."

Upon first meeting me, I might be more quiet, but as you get to know me I'm definitely more loud. I am a very perceptive person and if I know you well enough, will be able to pick out how you are feeling with just a glance. I tend to overshare, especially with strangers, but can also be closed off when it comes to describing my own thoughts and feelings. My favorite activities include doing anything that is outdoors, such as reading, drawing, doing crossword puzzles, and more. I love hanging out with my brother and my friends, whether we're just driving around in a car or taking a walk. I sometimes get into phases where I get fixated on starting a new project, such as learning how to make rings, or sew, and then eventually it tapers off. I am only consistent in some aspects of my life such as school and scheduled activities, but with my hobbies, my interests tend to drift. I can be anxious at times, especially if it is a close friend who is upset at me. I hate confrontation and being confronted, even though I know it can be beneficial. I am not that good at cooking but if there is a recipe I will follow it to a T. Timers make me anxious. People say that I am a people pleaser. I tend to prioritize my friendships over my relationships. I like to be reassured. ",

I am more reserved and would label myself as an extroverted introvert, meaning that being around big groups of people drains me. I would say that I lean on the quiet side of the scale and enjoy having time that is peaceful and restful. I like spending time with other people, but I also don't mind spending time with myself. Enjoying spending time with myself has definitely been something that I've had to learn over the years. I think long showers and grocery shopping can be considered herapy and really enjoy it. ",

I hate judgemental people because one day we are all going to die and nothing we say or do matters that much, and being that negative towards someone just because you don't like what they are is stupid and frustrating. I try to take full responsibility for my actions and I understand that just because something upset me doesn't mean that the other person intended for it to be that way. I try to deal with my frustration, anger, and sadness when it happens and not push it back, so that I can reapproach the situation with a stable and nonreactionary perspective. I want to make the world a better place but I often get overwhelmed with how to start, so I really value others' opinions on big world questions so I can make sense of the world around me.

When I hit a wall, as one can often do with school or with social life, I get sad, mad, and frustrated all at once. It is hard to share my emotions with others because I grew up with a mental illness that was mostly ignored and pushed aside by the people around me. I know that my emotions are often irrational, but I never had an emotional support system that would comfort me through these irrational thoughts and fears so I always thought I was crazy so I also ignored and minimized my own fears. It has gotten to the point that the only time I display anxious behaviors (shaking, grabbing hands, eyes moving) is when I'm on the verge of a panic attack because I am so used to suppressing my own anxiety. However, I am learning to comfort and take care of myself, and when I start feeling uncomfortable and I don't know why I make sure to slow down, find a safe space, and think out what I should do about it rather than just suppressing it until I cry from stress. :D yay me!"

Haha, I think I only work hard in school so that I can be lazy in the future. Work hard now and hopefully reap the benefits in the future! I also care a lot about my friends and would say that I try to be empathetic. I also love a good laugh, so I would say I'm pretty lighthearted most of the time and carefree. Don't get me wrong, I'm also kinda anxious sometimes and can often talk myself into hypothetical situations that aren't very likely and then just stress out about it. I think I also try my best to still be accepting of everything that happens even if it doesn't go the way I specifically want. I try to be optimistic about others but tend to be quite pessimistic about myself just because I've always been taught to assume the worst but hope for the best, but I fear I have taken it one level too far but just fixating on the worst. If I were to be in one state for the rest of my life, I would love to be at peace, it's something I yearn for and something that is so rare in this world. Anyways, I think I also like to embrace my childish side, so I like to have fun, be weird, and just ignore what the world thinks of me because at the end of the day, I'm still gonna be a hardworker and I believe that my work will speak louder than what others think of me, so I will just be myself, have fun, (of course, still be respectful to others), and just try not to lose myself to the world. I'm always down to have more friendships with other people and I can't wait to meet you and get to know you! I pride myself on wearing my heart on my sleeve, so I hope that you accept my unfiltered personality. Again, don't worry, I will always try to consider my actions if it makes you uncomfortable, but I'll definitely spring a deep philosophical question on you, like \"do you think joy or happiness is better?\" and something dumb like \"would you rather be able to teleport but only vertically, or be able to fly, but only 10 feet off the ground?\".

        "negative_text": "I've noticed that when I am in a bad mood, I tend to do really bad at being empathetic. It's difficult for me to both share joys and share sorrows with others when I myself am sad or angry because I try so hard to repress my emotions, that it also affects how well I can share emotions. On that note, I think my repressing defense mechanism can sometimes cause me to feel resentment. I try so hard to make sure to remove all negative feelings I have towards others or things that annoy me by repressing them. While this works in the short term, it can often build up over time since I don't let it out. I just don't want to be unhappy at others, so I push it aside. I'm working on it, but it's definitely something I struggle with. I also am quite a jealous person when it comes to career. I think it's because my self-worth primarily comes from my accomplishments since I've got nothing else going for me that I believe I should be proud of (since I think I'm below average in almost everything else), so when I come across someone who is average or above average in most things and are better at me in career-related things, I feel very attacked because I end up feeling worthless because who would ever want someone who is worse than another in every aspect. I am quite defensive about my career and it can definitely lead to some toxicity sometimes. As a result, just like I repress my emotions and try to not deal with it, I also do that with my friends who I feel threatened by. I still try to be their friend, but I try to minimize interactions so that I won't feel jealous.  "

Historically I have been involved in groups with a lot of different interests. In high school I did cross country, and singing and in college most of my friends I met through my dorm, Chinese class, the cross country team, my a cappella group, the Stoicism club I ran or the meditation group I was a part of. That is how I like to roll, make friends from many different groups, I find it provides a sense of balance in my life. I would say that friends are the most important thing in my life. I care about finding community, and typically that manifests in engaging in meaningful activities with other people. A running group is a good example of that, several of my close friends have come from the cross country teams I have been on. \nOther than being outgoing and enjoying connecting with people, I really enjoy cooking and meditating. Those are two big aspects of my personality. I love to cook and eat, it provides a form of flow and exploration in my day. I would say I am a relatively mindful person, I respond to situations with equanimity and don't dwell on things too much. That being said, I am quite sensitive to how other people feel. If other people are upset or sad, I tend to feel it in myself. I am very curious about other people and look for depth in my relationships. I really like people who are engaged very meaningfully in what they do. Purpose is a really important thing to me, and I gravitate towards people who feel a strong sense of purpose in their own lives. \nIn terms of living with me, I like order. I am a fairly organized person, and I don't like clutter. An unclean apartment with stuff everywhere gets on my nerves, so I will try to be good about communicating when it bothers me to you.\nI also love sports, watching soccer especially. \n",

I have a tendency to crave certainty, and when I don't know what the outcome will be for a big decision I have made, I tend to get wrapped up in thinking and doubt whether I have made the right decision. This sometimes has negative effects on some of my interpersonal relationships. This can manifest in anxiety, a concern about how things will turn out. This can lead to catastrophizing, which often has no evidence to support it. I would also say that I struggle a decent amount with imposter syndrome. For a long time I have been concerned that people like me until they see the real me, and then suddenly they describe I am not worth their time. I find this comes from not being perfect. I am a perfectionist, and am afraid people will judge me for my imperfection, even though it is a natural part of being human. So sometimes I can get wrapped up in what people think, and am afraid of people not liking me. It can be very difficult for me when someone is upset at me, I tend to blame myself. This is also a consistent theme where I tend to consistently blame myself for everything, even when I was not at fault for a given situation. "

I am more comftorable in one on one conversations. I am very sensitive and a pushover. I am working on stronger boundaries but it's still very difficult for me. I will try my best. I care a lot about other people, maybe too much. I have heard from friends and others many times that I am extremeley empathetic, but personally I don't know if I am empathetic or just very anxious and highly vigilant about people's actions and reactions. But also I trust my friends, and I'm inclined to believe them that I am empathetic. My feelings are confusing to me. I need a better way to process them constructiveley. I often overthink, and think a lot about my emtions and why they are there and what caused them, but without coming to an actionable solution. My favorite activities include hanging out with my friends (which is weird because I'm almost always anxious in social situations, but I do it anyway), reading, watching shows, going to raves, fashion, thrifting, and being in nature. I love strawberry creek on campus, especially the one part under the bridge with the crayfish or when there are trees and concrete blocks over the water where you can sit and be peaceful.",

From elementary school to college, my parents have never worried about my grades because I am intrinsically motivated and hold myself to high standards in my academic and professional career. Secondly, I have a very adaptable and open personality, and love bringing people together. I met my friend Shreya spring semester of our freshman year when she told me how she struggled to meet people and was thinking about transferring schools because of her negative experiences. However, I wanted to transform that experience for her and show her all of the reasons that I loved Berkeley. She is now one of my closest friends and is also fully integrated into many of my friend groups who are so happy to have met her. Another example is when I introduced two of my friends because they shared similar professional interests in marketing and the entertainment industry. I connected my friend Katelyn, who is a sophomore, with my friend Ashley who is currently a senior and interned at Paramount last summer. Katelyn is now interning at NBC Universal and has an offer to work in marketing analytics at Disney for the summer. I also think that I am a very ambitious person, and have spent a lot of energy managing a busy schedule. I strive to be a determined, empathetic, dependable friend that people can call whenever they are in trouble. I put I'm 110% in whatever is in front of me and always try to balance academics and social events. Lastly, I've met so many amazing people who have believed in my success, and in turn that has made me a very optimistic person. I see myself as someone who believes in people before they even believe in themselves, and constantly aspire to motivate people to greater personal achievements than they thought they were capable of.

I often have trouble accepting failure from myself and may hold myself to unachievable standards. I focus very heavily on self image and am at times overly conscious of any weaknesses or flaws that I may see in myself. I also tend to be drawn towards what seems impressive or valuable to other people rather than being authentic to my own interests and passions. I can lose myself this rush to be the best and chasing endless accomplishments and come off as overly competitive."

        "text": "Hello! My name is Colin O'Malley. I am a funny and cynical mess of a person. I am extremely studious, ambitious, and driven. I try to keep things extremely clean as I often worry about germs and disease more than the average person. I have good days and bad days like any other person but I tend to have some pretty, clinically significant, bad days. Therapy helps with this though. I am however incredibly social and love going out often and for many hours. I am a planner at heart but act on impulse while out trying to enjoy the moment. I am kind and good natured. Some would argue that I'm honest to a fault--some would say that is because of my struggles with anxiety. I try to be well intentioned at all times and am horrified by people who are malicious for little to no reason. I can be mildly judgmental but I think this is more of a human instinct than a definite issue for me. I am consciousness and extremely socially cognizant. I can be very calculating when it comes to human relationships. I sometimes wish this weren't the case but fighting my inherent Capricorn moon has proven to be a losing battle. As you can see I clearly like astrology as well. Though my astrological knowledge is more of a tool I use to conversate with people on whims. I love finding little fun facts and tidbits of information to bring up superfluously at gatherings. I love talking. I can rapidly fluctuate between emotional states quite regularly. While life has been a little harder for me emotionally the last few years, I do still think I'm a joyful person. I have optimistic and pessimistic tendencies, but ultimately I try to see the beauty in everything. I'm inherently curious and have a deep love and appreciation for learning. I think I can be a little snarky and self-absorbed; I think this stems from my academic accomplishments and general studiousness. Other things about me include my love and appreciation for meditation--specifically Vipassana meditation. I love playing video games. In general I love almost all entertainment mediums. I love listening to music. When no one is around, I quite honestly dance like no one is watching--because no one is. I love to blast music on the TV and just groove around the apartment. I am someone who enjoys expressing my body. While I haven't fully figured out my sexuality, I am certainly queer. I love to be around other queer people as often as possible because quite simply these are the people who make me feel more seen and understood than any one else. These are just beginning tenets of who I am. Glad to meet you!",

I think generally I do a good job keeping this in check but there are definitely situations where I slip up. I also get quite hangry. When I am hungry, I quite regularly get snappy. Additionally, while being around other people often fuels me, textbook extrovert, I have so many other private things I like to do with myself. I love to watch TV. I love to just lay on the couch away from everything listening to music. I love to write poetry and muse about the world. I love to do that with others as well, but its fun to probe your own existence. I also love to bake. I think another negative quality of mine is that I am a perfectionist. I am unrelentingly cruel on myself. I do not expect high standards from others, but I do expect them of myself to the upteenth degree. I over work myself--classic workaholic--and then wonder why I enter into states of intense glum. I love trying new things. Constantly searching for the next thing. This can be good and bad for me emotionally. I feel more like a human being--living life to the fullest--but I also feel as if it creates abundance theory within me--a condition where I am never satisfied with all the love and care that is already around me and afforded to me.

I will not stop when I put my mind something, which is why I love making personal goals. I believe in success for not only myself, but others.

I am also not good at hiding my emotions, so if I am discontent the other person will know. I also am avoidant and don't like confrontation. If I don't like something about another person I would rather keep it to myself or tell other people about tendencies I dislike rather than talking to that person about their negative traits. I am not a very confident person. I am usually not sure about the decisions I make in life and like decisions to be made for me. However, I think that this is a very passive way to live and I am stuck in it! When I recall past situations, I tend to remember how I felt but not details of what I said. This makes conflict resolution really difficult for me. I also get attached to people easily even though I am not good at reciprocating effort in my relationships, which oftentimes causes people to feel like they are close to me but that I am unavailable. I am not good at communicating and am a bad texter. This is probably because I'm easily distracted and will put off responsibilities, which for me includes texting/responding to people in my life. This trait applies to me when I am talking to people I am close to and people I don't know well. I also think that I act differently depending on who I'm surrounded by."

Additonally, I think I am a person who is willing to try new things. Over the past year I've dipped my foot in tennis, crocheting, cooking, dabke and running. I feel like I'm now pretty good at cooking, dabke and running, so I do commit to alot of the hobbies I try. Additionally, I am free spirited and love to explore new places. Hopefully we can try new things and places in the Bay. \n\nAdditionally, I'd say I am understanding. I know when it gets to exam season it may be difficult to manage house chores, so I do  intend to be flexible on both of us. Hopefully, we can make a schedule that works for both of us.\n\nLastly, I want you to know I am very religiously oriented.

I thrive on keeping life fresh and fun.\n\nI'm also a total extrovert who gets my energy from being around people, probably because I grew up in a joint family in India.

So, my roommate should be okay with me if I'm constantly inviting folks over for game nights or striking up conversations with everyone we meet.

If my roommate is stressing over a looming deadline or ecstatic about acing that presentation, I'll be right there with them, feeling all the feels. I just inherently pick up on people's vibes, and I care deeply. My roommates can always count on me as their rock and biggest cheerleader.\n\nI am also very curious and appreciate the incredible diversity of human cultures.

        "text": "Hi new roommate! My name is Desmond Kyu (he/him) and I am a 20-year-old junior transfer at UC Berkeley! I am from San Francisco and I would describe myself as a fairly minimalistic person: I enjoy the small things in life whether it be going out on a drive while listening to music or going out with friends and just spending a good time getting to know people on a deeper level. I would rank myself high on openness as I have a genuine curiosity for people, culture, and the world around me; furthermore, I also rank high in conscientiousness as I like to stay organized, thorough and tidy. My music genre consists of many elements around the world whether it be hip-hop, RnB, bossa nova, J-pop, and classical. Some of my hobbies consist of biking, weight lifting, reading books, learning new languages, and playing the piano! My current mental state is a bit complex in the sense that the pandemic and preceding series of events during that time taught me to love my own time and become independent which is something I heavily value now. I view relationships as a supplement to one's life rather than an absolute necessity; likewise, I feel that for me to maintain healthy and stable relationships, I would need to learn to love myself to avoid becoming codependent on others.

Instead of fighting for what I believe, I find myself avoiding conflict and pandering to people to not disturb the peace I have with people. Similarly, I don't like the fact that I am neutral in a lot of situations. When people around my family or circle of friends have a disagreement on something, I am always in the middle of the two polarizing forces because of my neutrality. While it may not necessarily be a bad thing, it definitely hinders the relationship I have with people since a lot of people I am close to do not get along with each other. I find it hard to find strong conviction in a lot of things because I am just so used to learning many new ideas. My relationship with a lot of people becomes scrambled because when I am invested in a person, goal, or activity, I am totally immersed in that experience to the point where I feel that I am too busy for others, making everything feel like a chore.

Sometimes I have difficulties in social situations and may say something out of place, which may leave whoever involved confused which leads to my own anxiety to overthink the situation and think about it for the rest of the day. I do want to be everyone's friend which may end up backfiring on me at times as well. \n"

Maybe, I'm just a boring bland person because I don't go out much prefer to stay at home and have trouble with strangers. I keep to myself a lot and don't talk much because is not in my nature I tend to overthink everything before I say it out loud. I think I'm quirky because I sometimes don't get social clues it takes me a while to figure it out. At first, I won't talk a lot because I need time to get close to you before I get comfortable talking to you then after a while I showed my true personality. With my close friends and family, I talk non-stop, but I have to be really close to that person. Also, I'm laidback drama free person I like to mind my own business. I'm a logical person and I usually make decisions using my brain not my own emotions I can be blunt at times without noticing it which some people can mistake as being arrogant. ",

I have this habit of talking negatively about my friends and family to my sister I would judge actions or things they would say. Which is not healthy because I'm just feeding into toxicity and judging people without having no idea what they are going through. I love to talk about other people because it makes me feel better about myself which I know is bad. I think is a coping mechanism I have. Another flaw, I have is I'm a bit slow and forgetful it takes me a while to fully understand things for example it took me a long time to figure out how to use a can opener or get the correct bus. I'm terribly awkward as well other people have to tell me how to do things step by step so I can understand or do things for me. An instance is that my cousin had to come and build my bed frame because I didn't know how. "

I tend to be organized and like things a certain way, but I really don't care what other people do with their own things. I guess that's true about a lot of things, not just roommates and possessions. I think I'm funny in an irreverent way, and I like to laugh even when I don't find something that funny, just to show I'm having a good time. I sometimes have a problem of repressing my negative emotions or not being direct when I'm mad, but that's because I don't always know if I'm in the right in my anger. I enjoy doing art and design stuff, and also crafts like knitting. I value creativity a lot, as well as humor. I think I'm a decently creative person, or at least I enjoy creating things. I sometimes like exercise and sports, but have never been able to do so on a regular schedule. That's one of the things I'd like to establish at some point in my life. I also like to talk about different topics and get other people's opinions, especially when there's a story and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I am competitive when I know I'm good at something and I care about it, but when it comes to proving you're better than others at meaningless, everyday things, I often find it hard to care. I do think I get annoyed easily, but I will try not to show my annoyance until I can't take it anymore. I do end up talking to other people about interpersonal things. Overall, I think I'm a very nice person, but I'm not sure if I'm a truly good person. When it comes to society-wide issues and questions, I might come off as selfish or self-centered, but I think that's something common among Asian immigrants. I care a lot about my family (Both current and future), so I'd rather take care of them well than contributing a tiny bit to bigger issues while ignoring them. That's one of my core feelings that I think others might disagree with, so I don't tell that many people about it. I keep a lot of unpopular opinions to myself, and don't always feel the need to speak up if someone says something I disagree with, since if I'm not close to them then it doesn't really affect me.",

I also am pessimistic and anxious about things, which makes me interpret the world in a negative way. This probably is part of the reason why I don't forget and forgive easily. I do tend to think selfishly when it comes to personal goals. I rarely feel truly happy for others; I have to really know, like, and admire someone to feel happy for their accomplishments. Otherwise, I either feel neutral or jealous. I get jealous very easily, the most harmful way being jealousy in friendships and relationships. When it comes to jealousy of careers or academics, it can push me to work harder, but in relationships it just sours things. The fun I have comparing things might come from the fact that I compare things automatically; I compare myself with others all the time. I'm also very insecure. I think I don't get close to people easily, so maybe I find flaws in them in order to keep myself at a distance. "

I like to think that I am the kind of person that is easy to talk to because I bounce off so many ideas at once but I am also paranoid about talking too much or too little or interrupting and overwhelming the person i am speaking to because oftentimes, I myself am overwhelmed.  My feelings are very much all over the place.  I am a very sensitive and intuitive person, this makes me overanalyze many aspects of my social interactions and life and this in turn affects the kind of person I am to be around.  My favorite activities are ones where I am able to be on the go or working towards some kind of objective.  I love skiing, running, kayaking, skating, biking and crocheting and playing boardgames and videogames with my friends.  I think that I have a very nurturing personality as well.  I love to host people and to cook for people.  I also am someone who needs a lot of reassurance and quiet time.  Since I overthink so much it helps me to know that I am doing the right thing or even if I am doing the wrong thing.  overall, I like to make small things in my life special and fun but oftentimes, this ends in me feeling hurt because I care so much about external people and things around me.  I am also someone who is perpetually late but I am a hypocrite cause I hate waiting.   ",

The most difficult parts about myself are that I have the tendency to be anxious and controlling when I feel uncertain or like I have little control over a situation or aspect of my life.  This is especially present in my romantic and close relationships.  There are a lot of times where things that should be fairly simple and easy for others are extremely difficult to me and I tend to latch on loved ones for support.  This leads to me creating a space where I am spreading a person thin or asking for a lot of emotional support that they may or may not have.  Its is an extremely vicious cycle because I end up overthinking more and feeling more and more anxious.  "

I really like to explore and just really value the space and moment I am currently in. I also really love pets (all kinds) and love to interact with them.

First off, I\u2019d describe myself as a pretty easygoing person. I\u2019m laid-back and open-minded, and I find it easy to get along with different kinds of people. One thing you should know is that I\u2019m quite organized and I actually enjoy deep cleaning the house. It\u2019s one of my stress-coping mechanisms, so you can count on the place being clean and tidy. If you\u2019re ever busy or stressed, don\u2019t worry \u2013 cleanliness won\u2019t be an issue! In my free time, I love to dance. It\u2019s a fun way for me to unwind and get some exercise. If you ever hear music playing and some commotion, it\u2019s probably just me dancing around. However, if it ever bothers you, please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know and I\u2019ll be happy to stop or turn it down. I really value a healthy balance between having my own independence and being social. I enjoy spending time with others and making new friends, but I also appreciate having my own space and respect others\u2019 need for privacy too. Cooking is another one of my favorite hobbies. I have an endless amount of recipe books, and I love choosing a new recipe each week to try out. I think it could be a great bonding activity for us if you\u2019re interested in cooking together. It\u2019s always fun to experiment with new dishes and share a meal.\n\nLooking forward to meeting you and creating a comfortable living environment together. See you soon!",

While I do enjoy socializing and spending time with others, I often need a significant amount of solitude to recharge and maintain my balance. This independent streak can sometimes be seen as a negative trait. People might assume that I\u2019m not putting enough effort into social situations or that I\u2019m being distant. There are times when my need for independence might come across as me ignoring someone or not including them in my daily activities. It\u2019s not intentional; it\u2019s just how I manage my mental and emotional well-being. I know this can be challenging, especially in a shared living situation, and I\u2019m aware that it might make others feel excluded or unimportant. I try to be mindful of this and make an effort to communicate openly about my need for space, but it\u2019s something that can occasionally cause misunderstandings. Despite this, I genuinely value good relationships and am always willing to discuss and find a balance that works for everyone involved."

I have made my best friends in this way. I also tend to keep things for a long time, so long haul friendships have been my things for as long as I can remember.

In group settings, I am often the observer of the group and do not tend to engage in the conversation. However, I very much enjoy having a one on one conversation with someone. I very much enjoy personal conversations. I am not very picky about anything. I like to be clean. I enjoy company. Alone times are great too and very important to me when I am socially exhausted. I enjoy playing video games with my friends and eat with them. Once I get really comfortable with someone, I say anything that is on top of my mind without filters. In the beginning, I think through what I say a lot and often stutter because of it. I try to be as neutral as possible while having a personality while doing so. I often overthink things a lot. I love sharing my feelings but I do not like it when I am the only one that is sharing. I feel threaten when I know nothing about someone that knows everything about me. Often times, I find it hard to articulate my thoughts perfectly as how it is in my head and I beat myself up over it. I often wish I can take back or replace what I have said and done. Constantly working motivates me. The less free time I have, the less lazy I get. I am ambitious at times and what to be perfect. I am easily distracted and can be clumsy at times.

I'm very empathetic and often take on other people's burdens without trying to. I am often sad / easily get sad, but spending time with my friends usually makes me very happy. My favorite activities include playing music, singing, learning languages, and hanging out with friends. I also overthink a lot and am sensitive. I always think I did something wrong but I'm trying to remedy that because everyone makes mistakes and that is okay. I also get jealous pretty easily. I like to think that I'm relatively self-aware but sometimes that's not the case. ",

I'm not sure if that's always been the case\u2014There have been periods of my life, especially in adolescence, where I seemed to really revel in social interaction and experiences. Since going to college, those feelings have significantly waned. \n\nI do not particularly seek out novel experiences. I enjoy keeping a small, close circle of acquaintances rather than a larger, more superficial one. And I've noticed that I am quite sensitive to outside stimuli: I enjoy the countryside to the city, a quiet night in to a \"fun\", active night out. \n\nI get anxious in certain situations. Public speaking, for one. If I feel out of place at a social event and am feeling particularly self-conscious that day, I find myself anxious. I also am quite the germaphobe so most things germ-related (like having to touch a very public door knob) gives me considerable anxiety compared to the average person. \n\nI really value human connection and my own self growth. I often think about my relationship with my family and friends and what I can do to be better to them. (I do really want to be better, but that doesn't always translate into direct results\u2014but I am working on it!) \n\n I am not particularly high energy. I enjoy quiet, lazy activities. I'm curious and love learning new things. \n\n\n\n",

As much as I love to dance, I do enjoy staying in and spending time watching a movie with those I love. I can be very attentive to detail, so if you tell me you like something I tend to remember smaller details about people. I can be quiet but once I am comfortable with someone I will probably talk your ear off about anything and everything.

I love making things beautiful so our room will be filled with art on the walls. I don\u2019t like throwing away things that hold even the smallest bit of memorabilia. My parents are hoarders so I get that from them. I am close to my 3 older sisters and admire them always. I tend to hold a grudge and you can easily see what im feeling through my facial expressions. I love to laugh and I have a strong work hard play hard mentality. I believe life is too short so you should not take one second for granted. However, im not a morning person epsecially before I have my coffee so don\u2019t expect that mentality till after 10. I love hosting so we will have people over a lot but I also love my alone time. When I trust someone, I treat them like family. I love being outside because it reminds me to be grateful for nature and my body and how strong I am. I disagree with my parents a lot because we have different political views but I will always love them. I become impatient when I get tired. I get frustrated when I smell bad things like Greek yogurt or when I hear annoying things like someone chewing their food. I don\u2019t show those frustrations, only to my close friends.",

For the most part I am an introvert in public settings unless I know the people and when that happens I am the loudest person there. I am not open to many people and I am not kind or friendly. I judge people negatively most of the time and try to find flaws within them, however the people that I pick to be part of my circle are in a different boat. I am very kind, loving and considerate towards them. I love the outdoors and nature as a whole. I am highly open to new experiences infract I get bored very easily. I am strong in most peoples eyes but am filled with self doubt and criticize myself very harshly. I am a very energetic and athletic person so most of my hobbies are in sports and outdoor events. ",

I tend to put everyone else before myself (which is only good in moderation). I lack a sense of self-care I guess you could say. This really affects my physical and mental well-being. Sometimes I get down on myself super fast and I quit without really trying a task to the best of my abilities. I tend to depend on others to help me when I know if I tried a little harder I could complete the task by myself. I am not very nice to myself in times like this and it really affects the way I think and the way in which I conduct my daily activities. "

Since I am studious, I like to sleep and wake up at a reasonable time so I can be productive during the day and get as much done as possible. However, if I set an early alarm, I will be very conscientious to not wake you up as well. I consider myself to be warm and compassionate. I will be here to celebrate with you in your highs and I will be there to support you in your lows. You can always rely on me and my loyalty is unwavering. I am extroverted so I love being around others - while I do appreciate down time, I love going out, meeting new people, and trying new things. Many things excite me, so I love exploring activities and places outside my comfort zone, whether that's skydiving, trying a new instrument, and traveling to an unknown place. I laugh and smile all the time, no matter what. ",

Some things that I left out, though, are that I have depression and a lot of my life has been hard, making it so that I had to grow up when I was a lot younger. I am still dealing with those residual issues with boundaries, communication, and acceptance. My book stays closed for certain things I deem necessary. I think a lot of that has to do with how I want to portray myself. I want to humanize myself and accentuate flaws, but also include that I am a work in progress, just like everyone else. I don't want to divulge exactly how MUCH work has yet to be done. I hold a lot in and do not like confrontation, especially if I would have to confront someone's main personality trait.

I try to see the best in everyone but I'm always wary of people taking advantage of me. So, I'm usually suspicious of new people. I usually get irritated easily and once I'm set on a single thing I'm determined to get it or finish it. I get easily discouraged especially if I'm having a bad day or something happened that completely ruined my day. One thing can literally ruin my mood or day. Sometimes my social battery wears off and I turn into an introvert. I get quiet once it happens and just kind of dissociate to make time pass by quicker. I tend to worry about a lot of stuff like my cat, friends and school. Sometimes I even get anxious thinking about it late at night. I easily can get very sad from just a single event happening. My personality usually shifts depending on how comfortable I am with the person. I am respectful to my peers, professors and strangers. My feelings usually shift day to day, normally I'm okay. Sometimes I'm sad, anxious or just numb. My favorite activities is relaxing with my cat, going out with my friends or playing video games. I also like looking for new clothes I just can't buy cause I'm a broke student and going on dates with my boyfriend. ",

I have learned to focus my energy a lot more, becoming a lot more focused, driven, and ambitious. I would say the cause of this change is the decision to be a doctor, which requires an equal amount of discipline as well as passion. I'm also more caring, compassionate, hard-working, and empathetic because of the hours I spend a lot of time at the hospital. \nThis description probably isn't super likable. But sometimes you can accomplish something awesome or be likable. At least with me, although I am working on being more likable. There's other things about me too. That was just my most recent and significant transformation. There are parts of me that have existed for longer. I am a very loving person. I love my family. I have 3 younger sisters who I adore. I love my mom and grandma. I studied abroad in Japan last spring, demonstrating an openness to new experiences and later developing leadership skills in my time there. It also demonstrated my impulsivity and curiosity. Those haven't changed. Something that has changed is me. I used to be super extroverted and now I couldn't be more of an introvert. Kind of shocking how the stark difference. So I don't really know or understand my personality at the moment. Even thinking about my personality, I am really just a person with a goal and I am trying to squeeze, shape, and contort myself into a person that medical schools like, want, and accept. \nMy favorite activities.. I like to read, go on walks, bake (new), volunteer, and visit the city. I also like shopping and traveling when I have money! I like hanging out with my sisters and my boyfriend. I don't know.. sometimes I feel like my personality isn't compatible with society's standards for a person going to med school so I've had to erase some of the more interesting parts of me.",

I used to value outsiders more so than my own family, which could be construed as generosity. However after I started developing a better relationship with my family, I stopped willing to be so generous to non-family. But this could also be a result of a history of people taking advantage rather than an actual personality trait. \nI'm also impulsive which also has a history of consequences. I could not live with a roommate I would get too irritated. I'm very easily irritated. I am also pretty bad with money but I am also pretty entitled to mommy's money (I had a bad childhood lol)"

I wish I was able to sleep in, but I'm thankful for being a morning person, however, finding a way to sleep in past 6:45 would be ideal. I love creating community, whether through music or other avenues. I do have a good amount of anxiety but am pretty okay at faking it until I make it. I'm not afraid of expressing myself and talking about the things I love, and I also am pretty comfortable being vulnerable and an open book. I'm a band kid and music nerd, along with someone who can get pretty annoying when talking about movies. I admire art a lot, and wish I got out of writer's block more when making my own.",

I'm really good at creating excuses against executing my creative ideas. I get pretty insecure within relationships at times and sometimes believe that I could be too much to some people or that some people only tolerate rather than like me.

I have a lot of things i want to do that I havenb't brought myself into doing.

While I am very intuned with my negative thoughts and emotions I have a harder time connecting with positive thoughts and emotions. I tend to hyper-fixate on negative thoughts and emotions, which may limit my ability to recognize when I'm having good thoughts or emotions. Again I grew up in a chaotic household so I may be more tuned to negative thoughts and emotions from this.

I tried to be as neutral as possible when describing myself because traits can be interpreted either positively or negatively depending on the other person's preferences. \n\nI like things tidy and clean and feel stressed out when they are not that way. Although I am social and enjoy hosting people I also prefer to know that guests are coming beforehand so that I can prepare the house and prepare myself mentally. I am particular about the music I listen to and I am sensitive to smells. I dislike when other people eat my food or use my belongings without asking and cleaning them / putting them away afterward. I do not enjoy being around people when they are drinking and I am allergic to allium so I cannot live with anyone who brings allium into the house."

I would need a lot of affirmations from my peers in order to convince myself that what I have done is correct and good. I expose my feelings too easily, even to strangers. I grew up being told that you should never let someone know too much about you, but I just can't seem to obey because I lose control when I start expressing feelings. I commit too much in a relationship and think every relationship I make would mean the world to me. I am also afraid of losing things not worth having & even losing things I've never had."

If I feel the group is lively, I'll often resort to finding the few stragglers that are not as involved in whatever teh group is talking about. I'm also pretty consistently anxious though, which can make the previously mentioned qualities about myself a negative aspect of my personality-- my desire for harmony turns into control and insecurity if I'm uncomfortable in a situation.\nSome traits that are perhaps less observable in social situations are my creativity and reflectiveness. I can journal for hours, self-analyzing (or diagnosing lol), predicting, processing, etc. and I sometimes find myself (ironically) distracted by my assessments about reality, trying to understand why things are the way they are. I also am creative in the hobbies I enjoy during alone time. I love designing clothing and turning thrifted cloothes into newer, moree stylish/useful pieces. I also love creating music playlists for every occassion, car ride, and emotion I experience. ",

        "text": "Hi! My name is Gaurav and I am a junior here at UC Berkeley studying Environmental Economics and Policy and Psychology. I'll start with everything I feel is relevant to you as a future roommate, and then I will get into other facets of my personality with any extra time that I have. For starters, I am pretty clean and when I do get messy I make sure it is contained to my room. I am used to living with other people, having lived in a triple freshman year and a fraternity my sophomore year. I now live with two of my friends where we each have singles. Both my housemates are girls, which though not technically implying anything, might be interesting/useful for some people to know. Anyways, a chief complaint of every person I have lived with is that I am not often home. I am pretty involved with extracurriculars and I go out to see my friends. Unfortunately, that means I spend the least time at home outside of sleeping and eating. That in no way doesn't mean I don't enjoy the company of the people I live with, I just like getting out of the house. Other than that some other relevant things include that I have a car. I am pretty flexible in letting others use it so long as you ask me first and fill up the gas. Also I would say I go out a good amount, probably every weekend. I think it is nice when my friends have company over/kickback or small party environments. \n\nNow in the remaining few minutes let me try and get into my personality. I am slightly hesitant to completely write uninhibited as this is for a class, but I also don't really care that much and this feels more like a journal entry. I'm imperfect that is for sure, many of my friend's have told me I need to learn to better advocate for myself \u2013 something I have spent a lot of time thinking about and currently work on. With the minute I have left, I really like being outdoors (rock climbing, surfing, hiking, or laying in the grass), going to museums or long photo walks, being with the people I love and animals! By no means do I already do this, but my goal is always to lead with kindness first. Being patient, gentle, thoughtful, considerate, and genuine are all qualities I try and embody and value highly.",

With that comes feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and general negativity. Recognizing the power of our internal dialogue I have been trying to incorporate mindfulness, and specifically metta mediation in my life. But to get into the negatives, I would say I have pretty low self confidence sometimes which can lead me to spiral into a disillusioned state and pessimistic view of the world. Additionally, I overbook myself often and feel pretty overwhelmed sometimes. I always consistently feel like I am not good enough. I really am trying to work on all these things and truly believe I can control how I feel about myself and the compassion I can develop and work on for myself so I have no hesitation to share these aspects of myself, but I refuse to let them define me. I can always try and be better. "

I have a tendency to be anxious and a little neurotic as well. I like to be as organized and clean as possible but sometimes it's just difficult to get out of bed so things can get a bit messy sometimes. I do have a lot of interests and if I'm able to find someone with similar interests as me, I can go on and on and have conversations without getting tired. I tend to be pretty awkward, sometimes it feels like I was born a week ago. I'm also a bit shy so I might be a bit quiet if its my first time meeting someone. Eventually though, I open up to people I've known for a bit and I can actually be pretty funny. Some of my favorite activities would include watching TV/movies, cooking, baking, going for long walks and chatting (or listening to music if I'm by myself). I'd like to learn sign language, how to crochet, and skateboard sometime in the future. ",

        "text": "My personality consists of an interesting mix of quietness and chaotic spontaneity. As an amiable acquaintance or a stranger, I tend to retreat into myself and be much more reserved or calm in my expression of thoughts, opinions, and emotions. I'm also shy with speaking up in large groups and in places where I feel not fully in control of my surroundings or in places where I don't feel fully prepared. Once I get to know people or grow comfortable with them, I have no problem being loud, affectionate, and even a bit childish. I believe my personality can be immediately summed up as kind, thoughtful, polite, helpful, and happy. I am generally in a good mood and love to laugh. I surrender myself to my positive emotions and tend to be more loose in cracking jokes, playfully teasing others, and am more confident in my body language. However, in serious situations, I tend to take on logical approaches to problems, and do well to remain calm when others aren't feeling that way. I also really love helping people and don't like feeling like a burden, so I tend to reach out to people I care about to aid them or let them know that I am there to support them. I love playing video games, with some of my favorite genres being open-world exploration, cooperative gameplay, rpgs, and puzzle. The current games I've been playing include Assassin's Creed 4, Valorant (which is the only fps game i like), and Genshin Impact. I also really like kpop and music in general. Some of my favorite groups include Mamamoo, BTS, and NCT. I play the clarinet and was learning how to play my dad's saxophone over the summer, which is something I am definitely going to continue to do. I like reading fiction and fantasy, I like going out and exploring new places or walking around campus to observe others going their way, and I like to doodle with different colors. Recently, my social battery has gotten a little shorter, and I tend to run out of energy quicker than I normally do. When I do, I simply become more silent than usual and become more still in my movements. I thrive in smaller groups, but shy away in larger groups. Once I get home, I feel much better and tend to be more talkative and excitable.",

Physical, short-term tasks are fine for me to start, but I run out of motivation or struggle to start long, mindless tasks or do tasks that I don't want to do. I think I can be annoying to those around me trying to do their work because I tend to distract myself by looking for others if they are around, otherwise I procrastinate by doing other tasks that aren't of priority. I also am quite lazy in tasks that again affect me personally -- such as getting up to cook myself a full meal. There are times where I can become snappy and be combative for no reason. If I ever lose my temper completely, which happens rarely, I do feel like it'd be hard for me to contain and control my anger. I am also not assertive and sometimes it is difficult for me to communicate on issues that impact my personal desires on a small-scale in an effort to maintain peace in a group. "

I left out how I experience a lot of negative emotions on the daily, such as shame, embarrassment, jealousy, and apathy. I compare myself to other people a lot, so it is easy for me to feel bad about myself. It is also easy for me to lose motivation, and I give up on things easily. My mother has always called me lazy. I spend a lot of time pacing around restlessly or doing nothing at all. I enjoy a lot of activities that other people would consider childish."

Although I can seem serious and intimidating at times, I'm also very dreamy: I have a rich fantasy life and at times while my body is set to autopilot mode my mind can wonder to numerous distant lands. I'm quite cerebral, but below the surface I am deeply kind and compassionate. I am incredibly sensitive and empathetic to other people's feelings. I have been the mastermind and therapist for my peers since I was a child. I'm very easy to live with because I value cleanliness and organization a lot.

I am able to study better in the room as I feel I am able to focus more when in my own space and not with a lot of people around. I enjoy watching Netflix and YouTube in my downtime. I love watching Suits, Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, The Office, Modern Family, and Abbott Elementary. I often miss home and will most likely not fly back. Though, I will often look at flights or vacations as a way to destress. I love going on cruises or being near the ocean or any body of water in general. It helps me relax a little. I tend to be overwhelmed during midterm season and finals season and will often deal with this by studying late into the night. I like to believe I am usually calm, caring, and kind. My other friends would likely describe me as loyal. I tend to go out more during the day and less at night. My social life is probably more similar to an old lady's. I like to be home early and be ready for bed at a set time. However, I do like being around friends and going out. Though, my social battery dies out quite quickly. I tend to spend most of my time studying as it also makes me feel less anxious about classes as I feel the more work I put in will lead to less regret later on towards the end of the semester. I also tend to overshare a little. However, I love discussing deep and personal topics as I feel that it really provides insight into a person and I just love thinking about such topics. ",

In terms of confrontation, I like to think that I'm willing to tell someone when something is wrong if I am comfortable with the person. However, if I'm not, I tend to exhibit avoidant behavior in confronting, which may ultimately lead up to \"petty\" behavior. I tend to be a loud person, and sometimes that may be inconsiderate of the people around my space. "

I have a regular sleep schedule from 11pm-7am which most college students these days lack. I am pretty regular about working out in some shape or form whether it is hiking or playing badminton. I also am not a procrastinator. I hate having the feeling of not finishing my homework or any work so I am usually very on top of what I have to do. I am also very proactive and a huge initiator in all of my friendships and relationships. I usually am the first one to reach out to people or the first one to follow up on someone or see how they are doing. For most of my relationships I tend to give a lot to people. I have a very big heart for people, but it also means that I often get hurt so much more and so much deeper. I also am a micromanager of my own life and sometimes of other people's lives. I like to have control in situations and be able to somewhat predict the outcome of things. ",

I always feel anxious when it comes to meeting someone because I fear I might embarrass myself or that they might not like who I am. However, after I become an extrovert. I'm pretty loud when with my family and love to dance and let loose when I feel comfortable. Being around my family is my safety net and I'm completely myself around them. It is the only time when I truly feel like I'm just me, unapologetically loud and obnoxious but also fun. I would say I'm also a kind and caring person. I hate confrontations they make me nervous specially if there's a high chance that they'll take it offensively and I'll become a fight. I think it's because I grew up around frequent fights between adults that it just takes me anxious whenever that happens. I'm very giggly even in award situations, it's my way of coping. I tend to have time periods where I feel low and have questioned if I might have depression. Normally when that happens I tend to isolate myself to reground myself and work on myself to feel better. I'm a virgo and hence, I'm very organized or try to be. When things are chaotic I get stressed out so keeping my space organized is how I feel stable and sane. I keep quiet when things hurt me unless I fully can't then I explode and tend to cancel people out of my life. ",

I can also be anxious sometimes and obsess over things I'm stressed out about but honestly you could just tune me out because nothing really helps relieve the anxiety until whatever I'm anxious about passes (usually with time). I'd like to consider myself a thoughtful and considerate person as well and I strive to take care and watch out for my friends and family. I zone out sometimes and I get lost in my own thoughts a lot but I can also lock in when needed. Okay that's all I can think of for now. ",

In addition to those negative qualities, I also am forgetful at times and it may take several times for me to do or not do a particular thing. I tend to procrastinate as well and especially towards household chores because I generally don't love cleaning. But once I get into the groove of it I'm actually quite good at it. A really bad habit of mine is that I'm often late to things. These are all negative character traits that I hope to overcome and improve upon. "

I need a lot of reassurance in my relationship and need the person I'm with to love me very completely, I tend to be fearful of others replacing me and compare myself to them. I can get obsessively perfectionistic to the point where I'm trying to tear apart the parts of myself that aren't really alterable. My worldview is pretty narrow and. while aware of this, I haven't put that much work into consciously expanding it. I used to lie a lot.

I go to bed around midnight and wake up at 9:30. I'm very extroverted and love to meet and hang out with people. I'm really excited to meet you! Pre-Covid I liked to dance- ballroom, swing, latin- basically any kind of partner social dance. I also love live performance, particularly musical theater. I play piano and sing- I know a bit of ukulele and guitar as well, and I'd love to learn the bass and/or drums. (I would absolutely love to perform as a guest singer with a punk/rock band during college.) I'm lactose intolerant but would really love some pizza right now. I enjoy trying new things and going on adventures- whether that be visiting all the 30+ UC Berkeley libraries, or doing a cross-country road trip to 10 national parks, I really love it all- especially road trips! I'm an ENTP and a Pisces (though I should have been born an Aries- I was premature- Aries traits resonate more with me) if any of that matters to you. I'm really excited about moving out and living away from home. I occasionally miss people or things, but generally I'm just really happy to be here and super motivated to succeed at Cal.

I am very outspoken and direct. I enjoy listening to other's opinions, and I'm fine with disagreements. I handle arguments well, and I do try to avoid conflict. I am not easily offended, and I assume the best in people's intentions rather than the worst. I enjoy self-deprecating humor, and I like to find the upside or funny thing in everything. I am very artistic, and I like being creative. I don't go overboard to be unique, but I like that I am firm in my beliefs. I express my feelings easily, and I have no problem speaking what's on my mind. I prefer to be happy rather than sad, so I do manipulate my own head a bit to keep myself happy if sad things happen. I think it's not about repressing emotions because I do let myself be sad, but being weighed down by sadness and negative emotions is just a very slow and not great way to live. Things are better when you're happy and enjoying the life around you. I have some anxiety from time to time, but that's usually well managed with healthy coping mechanisms. I have attention issues, and I do try to correct them. I am a very open person, and I will talk openly about pretty much anything and everything going on with me feelings-wise or just in my daily life. I have chronic pain issues, but I strive to not let it affect my life in an impactful way, and I enjoy making fun of myself instead of wallowing in self-pity. Looking at the upside is much better. I am very confident in myself, and I like that I have good self-confidence.",

My psychologist was not helpful with this issue, and while I have tried almost everything under the sun to fix it and have made improvements, it's not great yet. I have motivation issues, and I do try to fix this as well, and I haven't given up yet. I have social anxiety in certain situations, specifically \"parties\" like frat parties, and I do try to fix this, but it always lingers. It's fine though, I never really found that kind of thing to be essential to being happy, and I enjoy other group activities much more. I am not great at \"maintaining relationships\" in that I won't reach out to someone over text or etc that often if I'm no longer seeing them face to face often. However, I still love my friends, so when I do see them again, everything is good. That kind of communication is hard for me, but I do need to get better at it. I think that is linked to my motivational issues, and so when one gets better, the other might too. "

If you would like to know me in brief, I am a typical INFP-type person who loves thinking about some random things that might pop up in my mind during conversations. I have a whole list of things I love that sparkled in my mind before, such as \"the sound when stepping on fallen leaves,\" etc. I am sentimental sometimes, always being affected by the weather. I will try to find a \"perfect\" atmosphere in my place to optimize my personal mental state and emotional feeling! I am very easy to get along with and try to read the air in most situations. I am really bad at any kind of sports but love walking in the evening after dinner to feel the breeze and spend a short period with myself alone. This is the most common way I use to recharge myself. Listening to music is another way because I always believe there is a very personal story behind each song, so I really enjoy finding these stories through flows and lyrics. I like K-pop and my idol also acts as my emotional support for most of the time. Nice to meet you!",

It is really hard to visualize this, but I do believe there is a \"vibe\", \"atmosphere\", or \"setting\" that affects my emotions a lot. Also, I can be very sensitive sometimes. Being too careful makes me pay too much attention to others' comments and words, which hugely affects my days sometimes only due to one word I do not like. It also makes me form a comparatively negative impression on this person and this one may not even do that intentionally. Also, if I spend too much time on socializing with new people, I will be tired quickly and would not like to talk or meet anyone in short period. "

One thing you should know is that I tend to get tired of socializing pretty quickly so if I seem disinterested I hope you know I am not trying to be rude or trying to ignore you. I just need space to regain energy. I like to sleep early on weekdays that I have school and later on days that I don't. Another thing is that I really hate spiders so if you hear me scream it's probably because I have spotted one. I also am allergic to cats so let me know if you have one ahead of time.

        "negative_text": "I am an anxious person; I tend to assume the worst about vague situations, especially romantic ones. I often need reassurance from my partner due to these anxious tendencies. I have a hard time forgiving people for any slights they've made against me; sometimes I hold grudges, or refuse to communicate why their actions have upset me. I experience random bouts of extreme self-criticism, usually after a perceived failure or mistake. I am unable to tolerate making mistakes or not knowing things I find self-explanatory. "

I took her captain spot the next year. but i do get joy from doing things out of spite. if people would mind their business and not step over boundaries i wouldnt be spiteful. im also shallow when it comes to attraction and relationships "

Some of my interests include hanging out with friends, cooking, music (playing and listening), volleyball, and gyming. I tend to be quite an outgoing person so I love to get to know new people, but I'm also super down to be chill with people and vibe. I'll definitely respect your personal space, but also will always be here for you when you need it. I'm always happy to have deep conversations with you, but also to have fun and let loose a little. \nAnother thing about me is that I'm super organized and tedious. I love my google calendar and will plan events weeks ahead if needed to. Although I do love spontaneity and am always up for a good time, I still like to know what my weeks look like and plan accordingly. But with that, I tend to be quite busy and packed in scheduling, which causes me to be restless and unable to go with the flow. So, that's something I'm trying to work on.\nMy friends all describe me as bubbly, energetic, fun, but also I can be a little stubborn sometimes. I usually am easy going in terms of things that don't matter (where to eat, what to do, etc.), but when it comes to core values and people I really care about, I can be protective and harsh. \nI hope you we'll be able to get along just fine and that we'll become good friends as well!

So, you might see me constantly stressed or trying to pick myself back up many times. I will also plan way ahead with you for hangouts or chores because it keeps me more calm and collected. \nSecondly, about stubbornness, there will be specific things like no shoes on the floor that will be a rule. Although I am willing to compromise a little, there are specific values that I grew up with that I can't give up. But I definitely will try to be super understanding.\nFinally, a flaw that I have is being overly sensitive. Sometimes I will ask to clarify if we're on good terms if I simply feel a little bit of a tone shift so I'm hyper-aware of everyone's feelings (sometimes too much)."

I really enjoy art in all forms and I do a lot of painting, collaging, and playing piano. I highly value communication and consider it to be the most important part of my relationships with others. I also really enjoy being in and around nature. I love hiking and camping and use these activities to become more grounded and connected to myself. I am a very passionate person and get very involved and engaged with my interests and activities. ",

I have a lot of energy most of the time, even if I've gotten less sleep than usual or awake earlier. When I'm happy, I do little happy dances as if I'm listening to music even though I rarely have any earbuds on and no music is playing in public. My imagination runs wild, and it is reflected in the stories that I write. I love to read about mysteries, as I'm a very curious person. I have my days where my mood is dampened, although you probably won't notice unless we've been friends for a while; I've mastered faking positive energy.

        "text": "I am a very organized person . I like to have things done on time, in a particular manner. I guess some may say I am type A, however I do not treat others with the same exact expectations I set for myself. Although I was not always so leninent with other people, and often times I would be disappointed if other people did not do things in the same way I did. Over time, I corrected myself and began to accept all other ways of going about life. This transition has made me I feel become a lot more easy going with my friends and my day to day work life balance. I sometimes will find myself mixing up my accolades with my true personality, but if I had to define myself more explicitly from my percueved type A description I easily will say I am a hybrid introvert-extrovert. I love to meet new people but only by my own decision to do so. I like having time to myself to do as I need as well as go out when I am craving some kind of adventure. I find it difficult to really pinpoint words to describe my true personality though, and I will often rely on others to describe it for me. I used to be a v ery emotional person but over time I have closed off due to numerous reasons. Some times I still cry, other times I can get very angry. Most of the time I feel as though I am bubbly albiet a little dead inside but who isn't from time to time? Overall, I like to describe myself as someone as a friend to all. I truly have a nuturing aspect to myself that often times I will act on. I am a lover. I am sometimes a big hater. I am not one thing, I am many and I embrace it all.",

I tend to overshare and it leaves me feeling upset that I render myself incapable of hiding my feelings when they are not appropiate to express. I overcompensate for other people's lack of involvement in all my relationships, so I find myself pulling a majority of the weight in most of my interpersonal relationships. I can also be kind of a narc- my parents raised me very much so with the idea of what is right and what is wrong. When people do bad things, encourage harmful behavior and so on I can't stop myself most of the time from intervening. I want to fully be able to mind my business and understand that not everything needs to involve me. People should be allowed to make mistakes, and I should not allow other peoples mistakes to affect me. Other than that, I am fairly content with who I am. "

I can be pessimistic at times despite trying to maintain a positive attitude. In situations where there might be an undesirable outcome, sometimes I imagine or suggest the idea of that undesirable outcome occurring. This could be for a lot of different reasons such as me wanting to protect my feelings by depicting the worst/worser possible outcomes. I left out that I feel that I'm a pretty serious person in most social contexts; I find it difficult to easily become comfortable with others if I don't feel like I belong in that specific space, and that sometimes creates problems for me. I do warm up to people over time as I get to know them better and they get to know me better, but usually I'm the type of person who won't speak unless spoken to and I won't be the one to go up to someone to start a conversation. To sum this all up into one word, I consider myself to be introverted."

I also can sometimes respond quickly making it sounds mean or 'sassy' when i do not mean for it and it just ends up coming out like that. As soon as that happens I instantly apologize and get mad at myself for sounding like that. I also would consider myself more of a people pleaser because I dislike conflicts and do not want to cause problems so I sometimes avoid confrontation. "

I can spark up conversations, and even do random, somewhat unexpected things. On that note, I am also very organized and some would even say anal. I like things in a certain order. I thrive in structure, but I also love to be spontaneous. I am extremely caring and helpful. I almost never say no to people, which is at times a downfall. I can be a little sensitive when it comes to certain topics, but I also like to joke around a lot. I am a big, \"take what you dish out\" kind of person. One thing I can say for certain, though, is that I am very self-aware and considerate of my surroundings. There is an appropriate time and place for things. I am a big fan of nature and the outdoors. I would go on walks all the time if I could. With that being said, I love plants. I have tens in my room, but I would not go so far as to say that I have a green thumb. I am a big animal person also. I think that these different things make me more in touch with myself and at times reality. I try to be optimistic, but sometimes the realist in me takes over. I will not say no to trying new things, but I can also be stubborn. It is a little bit of everything, just to different degrees, with me! ",

I self-isolate to avoid eruptions and conflict. I am a big proponent of communication, but there are a fair amount of times when I simply do not say anything because I do not see the point. This can avoid conflict and unnecessary issues, but it can also at times prevent solutions from being found. I am very accepting and I try to be as open as possible, but sometimes this causes me to be more frustrated with those who are not also the same. I am generally non-confrontational when it comes to myself, but I will stand up for others in a heart beat. I can be snappy, but this usually occurs in defense. I try not to be offensive in any way, but my defenses are without a doubt active. I have trust and abandonment issues, so I do not let people in very easily. Once I do, I also struggle to let go. On the other hand, I also let go/move on from emotions very quickly. For example, I can get upset, and then I will just not be upset anymore. At times I will even repress what exactly made me upset in the first place."

I find it difficult to describe my own personality as I would not want to come across as too proud or as one who is incredibly fond of themself. I guess this means that one of my personality traits include humbleness and perhaps meekness. I sometimes worry that I talk about myself too much, because I very much dislike other people that talk about themselves too much without ever asking any questions back. However, I am quite extroverted and very social. I absolutely love meeting new people and being surrounded by many people at once in a social scene. At the same time I find myself longing for my own private space and some \"me time\" whenever I feel the need to recharge my social batteries. I think I am kind, considerate and generally a very positive person. I believe that what comes around goes around, and that your life is only as good as your mindset. I find myself very funny, but I'm afraid that not everyone would agree with me. I often use humor as an escape whenever I feel uncomfortable or find myself in a sad situation. I enjoy my own company very much. I love painting and drawing, listening to music while cooking and sitting outside to simply enjoy the sunshine. I am unfortunately very bad at confronting people if I have an issue with them that I wish to resolve. Perhaps this is because I'm not used to discussing difficult or sad things with my family. This has affected many relationships in my life and it is a skill that I'm actively trying to improve.",

I become manically obsessed with details to the point where it is difficult to start, but when I do it becomes impossible to stop. My personality also depends on my substance abuse. When I'm sober, I'm a completely different person than when I'm using. When I'm sober, I'm an egomaniac with an inferiority complex. I act with complete self interest with no regard toward others. When I'm sober, I'm a people pleaser who derives pleasure from fulfilling the needs of others. I'm intelligent, but have trouble channeling it. It's difficult for me to shift my attention once something has grabbed it, but until I'm engrossed I pay attention to everything and nothing at the same time. I need social interaction, but I also need my alone time. I'm constantly feeling the need to prove myself and am now realizing that there's no one to prove anything to. I thrive in structure, but can contend with chaotic events as they arise. Without a routine, however, I become a slave to my hedonistic nature. I'm extremely nervous in social interactions, but I try to hide it by talking too much in an attempt to seem knowing and capable. I'm extremely insecure. I'm sensation-seeking. I'm not sure if I'm disagreeable or agreeable. Extremely neurotic. I honestly think I may be bipolar, entering states of extreme manic behavior where I'm either extremely productive or obsessive before spiraling into depressive states so severe that I isolate myself for days. I think substance use worsens it.  ",

This can function both positively and negatively. For instance, back in March I became accustomed to working out every day without realizing I hadn't taken a rest day the entire month. After an injury (I tried to hop a fence to gain access to my workout equipment because I forgot my key) I became so depressed that I started self-medicating daily. Since then I haven't stopped. Oftentimes when I did something yesterday, it means I have to do it today or else it just won't feel right. I long for connection, but as soon as I attain it I do everything I can to sabotage it. I feel like all I do is let people down, so I try to do it before they become invested.

My favorite activities are reading, hiking, going to the gym, and creative activities like knitting, crocheting, and attempting to hand-sew clothes (though I usually give up partway through). I enjoy being with my friends, but I value peace and quiet as well, and I believe my hobbies reflect this. I think it's important to be self-reflective and appreciate the world around us. I enjoy doing a lot of solitary things, like hiking or going to the gym on my own, and I also spend a lot of time reading. However, I do love my friends and family and I am very happy when I find someone I can connect with on a deep level. I think I can have a tendency to get in my head about things (I'd maybe describe myself as socially neurotic), but I try hard to reflect on my emotions and behaviors and understand where my feelings are coming from. I think this is a result of being very introspective, because I can get in a rabbit hole of overanalyzing my social interactions, and that often results in negative emotions. I am not religious but I would consider myself kind of spiritual. I think it's important to be grounded in the physical world (as opposed to the digital one) -- I think growing up with the internet has strongly shaped who I am. I would call myself reactionary against digitization, which is why I generally avoid social media. I value a slower-paced, intentional lifestyle. I think boredom is extremely important, but people are no longer bored anymore because there is constant gratification available. I think it's important to connect with nature, with the natural world, and get away from screens. ",

Anyways, as a result I can get very lonely sometimes, and I get irrationally angry with my friends for minor things, or I feel jealous and left out when they do things without me. These are negative emotions that I really don't enjoy, and when I do feel this way I try to step back from the situation and think about it rationally. These emotional responses are spontaneous and I don't like that I feel them, but I can control how I respond to them. I'm not sure what else there is. I think that's the issue I'm most aware of - that I feel very negatively when I think my friends are slipping away, or when they don't match up to my idea of who they should be. I think I can get very insecure about friendships, and I feel these things despite being aware that it's unreasonable or irrational."

        "text": "I am a people pleaser. I am often described as warm and funny. I get worried about hurting other people's feelings and often think about how others perceive me. I am an extrovert and my mbti is enfj. To me, being an enfj feels a little concerning because the J stands for judging. I used to be an enfp in which the p stands for percieving. I wonder if I have become a bit too judgemental. I am indecisive. I am a passionate artist. I enjoy trying new foods, and I used to eat out a lot, however, I have recently started cooking and baking more at home. I have found that making food for myself is an act of self-care, which I value. I additionally value loyalty and friendship and am very proud of the close friendships I have cultivated in my life. Sometimes, I wish I had more friends because I love socializing and being busy, but going to a big school like Berkeley can feel really isolating as there are so many students here. I feel like I often get a bit too stuck in my own head and I have been working hard to avoid that. I am also trying to get better at allowing myself to dislike people, however, I was raised Buddhist, and truly see the value in giving everyone the benefit of the doubt and seeing the potential in all people. I often watch television and consume media as a way to not get too lost in my own thoughts, however, I am starting to feel like I may be too attached to my phone, and I believe I haven't been more than 10 feet away from my phone for likely the last 7 years!!! I think of myself as open. I love being creative and I often do crafts. I have recently started experimenting with bookbinding. I also love decorating and colors. I am passionate about school as well. I also take care of several plants. I am pretty close with both of my parents, and call them both almost every day. ",

I also fear rejection and failure, which scares me because I know those things are both inevitable. I take things personally that aren't personal, and it triggers my anxiety and depression. I do not like this about myself. I often am in a fight with my own brain, and I wonder how this happened! I am also an only child, so I think I can sometimes be self-centered and forget to see things from others' perspectives (however, I am often told that I don't seem like an only child....).  I also will clean if there is a deadline or an assigned task, but will likely not clean on my own instinct/intution. I think this has gotten better throughout college and as I have gotten older. "

I find myself to be biased towards my preferences. I am also not the best at socializing and can be shy at times. My social battery runs out when I try to socialize too much. I also have a stutter that is random but can be exacerbated by certain factors. I also try my best to communicate my emotions but I also am not the most capable at confrontation. I get nervous and anxious more often than most people and I may be depressed."

However, I think this is a strength of mine because I have compassion, I am forgiving, and I am courteous due to my constant evalutions of other people's assumed experiences. I would say that I am extroverted in general but since COVID, I have become more worried of my social interactions. They often take more mental labor but once I find a single topic to relate to, conversations come easy to me. I notice myself sometimes talking too much because I have a need to feel seen and my opinions heard. I love trying new things so I would say I am adventurous. I enjoy being busy but I think that comes from a feeling of inadequacy with contentedness. I am a diligent planner. Often, I find it hard to motivate myself so sometimes being stressed helps me to complete my tasks. I am a very reflective person and strive to be the best person I can in all areas of my life. Sometimes that can be draining but I find comfort in knowing that I am trying. I really care about my friends and feel like my effort is over-the-top but also goes unmatched by most people in my life. Part of that I believe comes from a desire to be the best, which creates a competition in my mind that is fueled by unrealistic expectations. That being said, I adore fairy tales and I love seeing people happy-it makes me happy! I hate being alone so my favorite activities usually include events with friends or in busy places like movies, coffee shops, and restaurants. I also have always had a passion for creative expressions although I am not particularly good at any. ",

I would say I left out feelings of insecurity that are probably the cause of some of my more apparent personality traits. I can be bossy at times because I prefer things my way so that all my expectations are met. I think the desire for control comes from a place of feeling like I need to prove my value and worth. Which is a weird thing because my parents would support me if I worked minimum wage right out of highschool or if I went to a good college. It was internally motivating factors that pulled me to go to college, not really external so I'm not sure where that desire for success and perfection comes from. I am honest to family and friends when I describe myself as craving authoritative approval- I love when family, teachers, or other adults are impressed with me and tell me I am doing a good job. This can cause me to experience burnout often though and distract myself with social media to an aggressive amount. "

If I have to put myself out there, I'm fine with transitioning to my extroverted persona, however I'll need time to recharge after doing so. I would describe myself as someone who can do the work but also needs time to relax and recharge. You'll often see me oversleeping, and that I often do the same routine every morning and night. I'm a stickler for routine, tidiness, and organization- and if my space isn't neat that can often drive me crazy. I love watching kdramas, I collect squishmallows, and I often scroll through tiktok. I love dancing as well. Some other strange facts about me is that I hate staying in the restroom for too long and I love having eggs in the morning. I am also Muslim, meaning I'll need my own space to pray 5 times a day. I love going out to eat and get boba, which is something I'll look forward to! I also love movie nights and staying up late to marathon a show. ",

Some other things are that I struggle with depression and anxiety, meaning interactions and talking to people can get me very anxious. I also have very low self-esteem, and hate taking pictures of myself and often avoid looking into mirrors. This is part of the reason why I need a clean space, in order to feel control of some part of my life. I am also very anxious about the future and what job I'll be going into after graduation. I often feel behind and that I need to 'catch' up although there isn't any need or reason to feel that way (eventually I'll get to where I need to be). It's just that I grew up in a high expectations family, meaning I was pressured to be \"number 1\" and get good grades. Coming from an immigrant family, I wanted to make my family proud but evidently, I created an unhealthy way of coping with stress despite the good work ethic I maintained throughout my education. Which is why I often avoid linkedin and smile reluctantly whenever I hear about good news from friends (although I am happy of them), some part of me feels anxious and worries if I'll get to where they are career wise."

I hate getting yelled at. When I get mad, I tend to distance myself from anyone that I love because I find it is the only way that I feel safe and like I won't get hurt. I do not know how to apologize well. I try my best not to get into situations that can lead to having to apologize because I am not really good at it. If I feel someone doesn't want me around, I will not make an effort to find out why, I will just ignore them as well. I prefer being given direct feedback than someone talking behind my back because when that happens I feel like I have been betrayed and that I no longer want to talk to that person. Sometimes I give up on friendships easily when I feel they have also given up on me. "

However, I always look to do more work than anything I ask of anyone. If I ask someone to do something it is because I am in desperate need of the help, not because I want to give someone busy work. I am a very independent person but have always taken care of others and see this as a major innate trait of mine. In general I'm a very positive and upbeat person, although I can run a little anxious sometimes. I have what is referred to as \"nervous energy\" but I have been told I am very charming!

I have a bubbly personality and am friendly when meeting new people and in most situations, and I enjoy new experiences and meeting new people who are also open to making friends (as opposed to asserting myself into an already established friend group). At times though, I can be a little bit shy / awkward, especially when interacting with people not of my age / of my senior, but having someone introduce me to the group helps immensely. I like most people by default, I try to think positively of people. I am clean, polite, and very considerate of other people, sometimes to the point of inconveniencing myself. I hate being rude, and am very non confrontational, even in every day situations like talking to customer service. I am diplomatic in the sense that I am good at helping other people around me solve their conflicts, and talking to them / approaching these more difficult issues in a way which I feel would make the most sense for them. I am also very 'soft' / feel very deeply and can sometimes overthink, and express these a lot to my friends (for example, I can tear up when expressing about how much I appreciate my friends). I don't get angry very often, and if I do, I show it by crying to myself as opposed to any explosive / outward expression of negative feelings, mostly out of frustration. I like going out and exploring new places, I like being spontaneous as opposed to planning trips out to every detail. I prefer having a general idea of what I'm going to do, then 'winging it' and seeing where it takes me from there. I think I am somewhere between an introvert / extrovert. I like going out and spending time with people, though I would prefer most of that time to be quality time spent with people I am comfortable with, as opposed to situations where I'm always only meeting new people. I also am introspective, and continually set goals for myself to be better / keep journals to keep myself accountable, though sometimes I struggle with wanting to take up too many things at the same time, and get overwhelmed.

I enjoy listening to people and I believe that I am really patient, so we are bound to have minimal amounts of issues between us. However, you must know that I get easily overwhelmed with crowded and/or disorganized rooms and this is the one thing where my patience runs out fast. I also like to keep all of my items in the same place every time or else I lose track of them, so if you ever borrow anything from me please leave it exactly where it was before when you return it.\nTo be more concise, I would describe myself as kind, patient, and outgoing, but also strictly organized and with a high prioritization for sleep and some alone time.",

I am naturally curious so I enjoy traveling and finding new experiences. I think of myself as a sensitive person who also likes to approach situations with a patient and gentle demeanor. My favorite activities include cooking plant-based meals, playing basketball with friends, and grabbing coffee. I feel like I am usually quiet, but I can get rowdy and fun when I am out with friends. I also love planning outings and making detailed schedules for trips. I feel like a perfectionist and usually run 500 stimulations in my head before I act.",

I am persistent and that can be annoying to friends and family especially when I nag. I tend to collect many people's opinions instead of acting from my own moral compass, this might stem from low self-esteem.

I really enjoy talking to people once I am comfortable with them and I can be seen as a little random in my actions and the things I say because I kind of just say things out loud as they come to mind. I am a bit of an over thinker as well as being highly sensitive when it comes to my emotions. I am conscious of boundaries when it comes to living with other people and I always ask before doing things that I know require me to ask for the okay from the other person. I do, however, have some high standards when it comes to being organized. I won't call someone out on their disorganization because I feel like that isn't constructive and kind of rude. This leads me to my next point which is that I avoid conflict at all costs. Although I like things to be clean to a certain level, I will restrain myself from getting on someone else's case for the sake of keeping the peace. My favorite activities kind of speak to my personality especially my gentle nature. I enjoy being home either laying on the bed watching something or in the living room and I do all of this quietly, keeping to myself for the most part. You can also find me listening to music and just going with the flow of things. I like to engage in constant conversation with whoever I am with, but I also recognize that there are plenty of moments where silence is the preferred ambience and I will adhere to that. Speaking of which, I am the kind of person who is flexible and adjusts to change in order to contribute to a peaceful environment. I am not of the personality type that can be seen as taking up all the air in the room. I prefer to be someone that helps maintain a good atmosphere within the living space. ",

I'm also a bit of a pessimist, usually focusing on topics of conversation revolving around negative emotions. Furthermore, I am a very insecure individual and that can be deduced rather quickly if you analyze the content of my conversations because its something I bring up a lot as well, but I have been working on minimizing that. I don't know how negatively this personality aspect is seen but I am also kind of nosy. While I try to have boundaries and respect others, it doesn't silence the curiosity that I have in regards to the lives of the people around. For instance, what they are doing, thinking, what plans do they have or who they might be having those plans with. It can be a bit invasive which is why I chose to leave that out in the previous response. "

I have had people tell me on multiple occasions that they get stresssed from being around me becuase I am always freaking out about something or just sleep deprived. I have a tendency to be very negative, as you can probably tell :/ I have problems with seeeing the positive sides of things and that in itself stresses me out because I feel like I am bringing the vibes down or whatever. I fear that I have bad energy. Anyways- In an attempt to be more positive- One thing I am proud of about my personality is that I am very concious of other people's feelings. I truly try my best to make my friends and family feel loved and am constantly worrying for them lol. As a person- I would decribe myself as very emotional rather than logical and tend to be creative- I paint and draw a lot and I feel like it bleeds into other parts of my life. I don't really like my peronality but now I kind of feel like my answer is pathetic. AHHHH- I do NOT DO WELL in timed situations and this countdown clock thing is really stressing me out, if I had more than a minute left, I would try to make my answer sound more self-assured because I sound like a little b*tch...

You may also encounter me as the exact opposite of this and find me to be a good listener who will offer advice when and if you want me to, if not I am cool with just listening to you talk :). I say I enjoy creative hobbies such as drawing, painting, embroidering, and crocheting but I am quite honestly terrible at consistency and have a hard time sticking to one craft for a long period of time. I do still, however, enjoy doing these hobbies as a form of stress relief or distraction. I am very into making collages and browsing through art and scraps from online orders, freebies, or packaging that I find interesting to add to my collages and journals. I also love reading. Overall I am quite shy and awkward but I think I am fun to be around once I get comfortable with a person. ",

I usually can have others open up to me too because I am kind. Further, I am on the extraverted end. I like to socialize and talk outside of just being open. I have a lot thoughts on my mind going thus I let it right out to the people around me. I do of course know my boundaries however. I am conscientious in the mid range as I am usually very clean and do concern when I see a mess or not being organized in other degrees. So I like to clean when I have free time. Lastly, I have a broad range of friends as I am extraverted I tend to adapt to different environments and different kinds of people.

Yes, I explained that I am extraverted earlier but I like to be on my own as well. It is a great feeling whether I am out pursuing a sport, walking, or any other thing like studying for my academics. Another thing would be that I do not like loudness sometimes. It can be a little irritating especially if I am trying to study. I would say that it is a little difficult to answer this question. I believe our upbringings do to an extent help form our individuality/personality and what we see as norm. Thus these negative factors we may not see may be our own norm. So now a thought to me is not expressing concern on others wrong doings. It can be an ethical aspect of an individual to do so by talking on others wrongs. Of course a correct/kind approach would be necessary. "

I'd say I'm an extrovert. I also really need time to just turn my brain off every once in a while, but I prefer doing it with others around me, even if we aren't doing anything. I don't like being alone. I have a dog to whom I am way too attached, and I think I get this way with my friends too. I love often and easily. I have a hard time paying attention to things and am always trying something new. I can get a tremendous amount of work done in an incredibly short period of time if I have to, especially if there is someone other than myself counting on my success. I don't sleep much which makes me feel more tired than I'd like to. I am unfortunately someone who drops the ball sometimes, more often than others do. I attribute this to my ADHD (which is pretty bad lol) but I sometimes fear that I am just lazy or forgetful. I do not think I am as nice to myself as I should be, but I'm working on it.

I stop talking to my friends and the people that I care about because conversations about my feelings are too overwhelming and distressful to me. I also left out that I am somewhat messy when I am in a depressive/anxious state. I feel that when my life is a mess, my room is a mess as well. I also left out that I am very picky with the people I get along with and let into my life. If someone's presence brings me ANY type of anxiety, I tend to shut them out and leave it at civil conversations when needed. I do not like when people ruin my inner peace, so I am very picky with who I consider friends and who I will develop caring feelings for. I suppose then that this reveals that I can be a very dry and shut down person with others. "

        "text": "As a kid, I was always described as shy. This changed when I discovered theatre. As I grew up, I became significantly more outgoing, able to communicate effectively with others as I learned what it was to participate in a social group. However, due to moving and bullying I was deeply insecure with my being. I am described as outgoing, funny as charismatic, but the reality is that it's a facade out of fear of people's judgement of me. I am severely introverted, able to participate in discussions for extended periods of time, but also needing to be alone to recharge after being around people. I find myself drifting off when there are may people around, fading into the background instead of constantly being in the middle of everything. When I try to compensate for this, I overcompensate, sometimes annoying those around me. Others appreciate it, however. Mostly other introverts who no longer need to consider participation as I dominate the conversation. I have both gained and lost friends because of my ability to talk about nothing for extended periods of time. I appear smart because of my ability to make quick connections, making me sometimes appear more capable than I am. I am often capable, however, just full of imposter syndrome and self-doubt. I am a fast learner, leaving others in the dust as I pick up on tasks and patterns with ease. I am proud of my ability to recognize patterns, from learning math faster than my peers to recognizing people's faces from far away. I immediately know where I met someone, but have trouble remembering names. I need to repeat things to myself many, many times in order to commit details to memory, but I can generalize with ease. I have trouble both asking for and accepting help, and consistently feel as though I need to accomplish everything myself. This compounds my self-doubt, as when I can't accomplish things I feel as though I am diminished as a person. I have trouble remembering dates and lose track of time, meaning I can forget both my own needs and those of my friends and others around me. I do love my friends, and most of all having movie nights with them, particularly with bad movies. I am multi-faceted, having personal hobbies like handicrafts and reading as well as social ones like theatre and dance. I was a swimmer in high school, and still consider myself athletic, even if I don't keep up with it as much as I would like to. ",

One thing I consistently leave out, however, is that I really do have trouble forming genuine connections with others. As a child, I was told by someone close to me that they didn't know if I was capable of love. I've always had trouble even acknowledging my own feelings, let alone letting others in on what I'm thinking. I'm terrified of judgement, meaning that I would rather let people like the surface level, perfect version of myself instead of loving the full, scared version of me. I've tried very hard to change these things, but it takes time and practice, and forces me to acknowledge my fears, which I hate. It's hard not knowing what you're feeling, and harder to take a step back and let other people know that you're scared of your own being. I am so worried about what the future holds, and I constantly catch myself both romanticizing and catastrophizing what may or may not happen in my life. I'm comfortable in my being, but scared of what my existence means in a more social setting. I'm worried about how much I worry, and yet it makes it that much harder to actually do anything about it. Social perceptions are some of the hardest things for me to conquer, and I force myself to practice nihilism just to get out of my own head a little bit. "

I've been told many times that my name suits my personality. I'm a pretty easy going person. I don't get embarrassed easily so I say whatever comes to my mind and I don't tend to overthink things. I would say I'm a kind and agreeable person. I'm not the argumentative type, except that phase I had when I was 16 but I don't like to think about that time. I like to wake up early in the morning, have a sweet breakfast, go for a walk, help my grandparents get ready for their day, take my siblings to school, help my mom tidy around the house, and head to work or class. I'll meet up with my friends after and head home around 8pm. Then I'll get ready for bed at 11 pm and repeat. Some say its a boring life but I enjoy the simple things. I'm a practicing Muslim. If I'm not listening to Islamic lectures or Quran, I'm probably listening to taylor swift. Sometimes I struggle with anxiety and depression but I remind myself of the blessings I have and it usually helps me feel better. I don't like to stress out over things, so I don't mind not having a lot of money, the best grades, or a crazy exciting life. All that matters is that I'm in good health and my family is doing ok.I also have the worst memory so its super hard for me to talk about myself or reflect on my personality. I know I'm an aquarius but i don't believe in horoscopes so i don't think that says anything about me. I think every time I've done the myers briggs personality test i've gotten a different result because I don't have strong preferences over situations or reactions and I can't remember how I conduct myself around certain people. My personality is fluid I guess but I'll always remain easy-going and simple. Wow this description doesn't say anything about me I'm not that good at talking about myself.",

Sometimes I let people make fun of me for their amusement and I say it's all in good fun but it hurts. At home I can be so mean to my younger siblings. I'm resentful of the fact that I have the most responsibility just because I'm the oldest girl so I lash out at my siblings, especially my younger brother who is 1 year younger than me but only gets 5% of my responsibilities. I'm not an affectionate person at all. I can get really lazy because I hate overextending myself. Then I regret it when I don't get the results I know I can get if I just tried harder. I run away very easily from situations where I feel too vulnerable."

I feel things pretty deeply, which can be awesome when things are great, but it can also be tough when things aren't going well. I enjoy doing creative stuff like writing, drawing, or playing music for fun. Being around people is something I love, so parties and hangouts are my jam. I'm curious about the world, so I like trying out new things and meeting new people. I'm also kind of a problem-solver, so finding cool ways to fix things is something I enjoy.

Feeling unsure about myself is another thing. I set high standards, and sometimes I feel like I'm not hitting the mark. It's like I doubt myself even when I shouldn't.

I think this has given me both pros and cons. Pros include creativity and ideation, as well as an ability to spend a long time on one very interesting topic (like games) or problems. Cons might be that I can easily overthink or worry when it may be useless to do so. I have usually had a hard time focusing on what I want to focus on, and generally cram for things last-minute, but I've improved this recently with some deliberate training. I know I've also had some level of OCD as a child, and I wonder if that means a high level of neuroticism. To this day, I don't feel like I can always easily shake off \"bad thoughts.\" As far as extroversion, as a child I was extremely shy around new people and would not be able to talk to a stranger no matter what. Surprisingly, after my first semester of Cal, I have become very different (at least on the surface level), I am very happy to talk to anyone that I cross paths with -- whether it be an Uber driver or a student sitting next to me. With that said, I'm only like this when confident - and talking too much always ends up draining me. I still strongly dislike very large groups.\n\nPeople I like the most are usually those who I can relate with on some level of myself (creativity, perspective, the way that I like to point out small details about how people think). When I am around people I like, I am mostly myself, very enthusiastic, joyous, and joke around a lot. It tends to make me very confident most of the time.",

However, perhaps there are some more \"malevolent\" things I left out.\n\nI rarely hold grudges, but if I do, it usually takes me a while to overcome them and I hold onto them.\n\nI can be pretty jealous to the point that its unhealthy both for me and for other people. \n\nIf I dislike someone, I am pretty cold to them. I am generally fine with helping anyone if they ask, but I always go the extra mile for people I like. Someone I dislike might just receive an \"I don't know how to help\" in the worst case.\n\nBecause I can be very absorbed in my own thoughts or problems, I can disregard and take for granted those who care about me. This is probably the number one issue that I create for myself as far as my relationships go. This hurt my relationship with my ex, my parents, and friends (if I don't reply much).\n\nSimilarly, the same issue can hurt me in my own personal life. It keeps me from honoring commitments like meetings because I can just straight up forget about them. It can cause me to procrastinate. And it can cause me to worry and freeze up. Another way to put it is: it makes me afraid of CHANGE. I want to hang on to the past pretty often, whether it is bad or good. Because what is familiar feels strongly comfortable to me. \n\nFinally, I have insecurities that can stop me from feeling as confident as I could. They can also drive my decisions and my state of mind (for example, worrying too much what other people think can lead to a spiral of thoughts. Example: I want to get X person to like me. But does that mean I'm being unfaithful to Y person? Rather than, \"I don't mind too much what people think of me.\""

Although I would like to do the same, I have a hard time bringing negative stuff up to people I'm not close to. When something comes up, I don't hesitate to tell my partner, best friend, or sibling. However, I find it harder to have the same open communication with casual friends, co-workers, etc. Other than that, I think I was candid about my shortcomings in the previous writing task. I know that I have more negative feelings than normal, but that's okay. I'm working on it, and it doesn't make me any less than others."

I tend to have big feelings. id say I'm someone who feels a lot or feels things strongly. if I am upset I do my best to not let it bother me a lot but I do feel like I am the type of person who likes to talk about how I'm feeling. it allows me to process my emotions and almost see it laid out in front of me and not just as a big pile of munbo jumbo in my head. Some of my favorite acitivies include playing tennis and going to the golfing range, but not necessarily playing golf, I simply enjoy waking some balls, especially if I'm feeling stresses, it s a good way to get the energy out and for a second focus on something else besides what is consuming my thoughts. i like to go out an dhang out with others, and going out to eat with friends, I feel like those always fun experiences that we can have as a collective. i also enjoy puzzles and going into bookstores and buying a book that I will never read hahaha but its nice to know I have the option. I also call my mom at least once a day just to say hello and catch up since she lives in LA and I am in Berkeley right now. Overall I would say I am someone who enjoys having a nce time with others, quality time with the people I care about matter to me and is important and something I look forward to do.",

Although I do agree with my friend's description, I doubt the genuineness behind it. I take most compliments to be out of pity, and I don't want to be a bother to those around me. If I'm embarrassed, I tend to isolate myself further. This is not that bad when I want to keep to myself, but is detrimental when trying to get to know other people. If I'm too comfortable my jokes might turn into self-deprecating comments, which makes me too self-conscious about how I behave around other people. Paranoia makes me want to jump to the wrong conclusion before I get the full truth of any particular situation. \n"

That is until they break my trust or do something that is against my values. My values are probably the most important thing to me. I value family more than anything in this world. They taught me how to love, care, be myself, and that I will always have people in this world that are there for me. I am constantly being told by my family that I am not a flexible person. I have a schedule and a plan and usually do not deviate from that plan. This definitely comes to hurt me in the long run. I am less inclined to be spontaneous and try new things. As I have gotten to know myself better, I know that this is a quality that will never change. I am tied to my routine and that is just the way things are. I have started to accept the things about me that I don't love and cannot change. This has helped me get to know myself better as a person. I love knowing people and feeling comfortable. I'm not usually one to hang around in an uncomfortable situation. I usually have a better time with my friends (a few close ones) than going out with a bunch of random people. I keep my truest friends close. I have gotten lucky over the years with the friendships that I have made. That is another thing I value intensely: friendship. I have close groups of friends from all over in different aspects of my life, but only have a few from each aspect. I like it that way. I enjoy the close relationships I have with these people and they bring out my truest self. I also LOVE to know things. I love to give people advice and seem knowledgable. Not that I am not actually knowledgable, but I want to be the person that my friends come to for advice, so I try to give them as much advice as I can. I have always strived for achievement. As the oldest child, this pretty much makes sense. I have messed up once, and I will never do that again. My parents' opinion of me means everything to me. I am my worst enemy sometimes. I push myself to the edge and have high expectations for myself. I try not to compare myself to others, but this makes me compare myself to myself even more and try to better myself in the process.

I usually look at the world in a glass half empty mindset and always think about the downsides to a decision. I also cannot portray myself in a way that I am not feeling. In other words, I cannot hide the way I am feeling ever. Sometimes it would be easier to just be able to hide the way that I am feeling or lie to people about my opinion to avoid conflict. I am an honest person. There is nothing else to say about that I just cannot lie about how I feel. I usually do not deviate from the idea of my night or day that I have in my mind. I always have to plan ahead and cannot sit still. I wish I could learn to relax. I physically do not know what to do with myself when I don't have anything to do. I would so much rather be busy than have nothing to do. This is why relaxing vacations are just not for me. I also just don't connect with that many people. I seem cold and untrusting in the beginning, which I am, but once I approve of someone I am no longer cold. I just have high standards for people, which usually ends with me being let down. "

I am also unafraid to cut people out of my life quickly if I do not feel I am being treated correctly.

Going off of that, I am pretty independent and appreciate being challenged because I feel that it makes me a stronger person.

I love being outside because when I am outside I feel disconnected from technology and social media, which aren't the most positive things. I laugh very easily and enjoy being around those that can make me laugh. Being silly is one of my greatest personality traits as I too love to make people laugh. I also love sports, live music, good food, and travel. I would consider traveling one of the most important things to me because it can teach you so much about people and give you perspective and gratitude. I don't get mad super easily, but sometimes if I am really tired I can get agitated easier. Sleep is important to me and will definitely affect how I can operate the next day. I love helping people and giving back to people. It is truly one of my greatest joys and is something that makes me happiest. I would overall consider my personality to be pretty happy and bubbly. ",

All that being said, I am super excited for a new roommate because I love being homebodies with other roommates, so if you are one, we would be a perfect match.

Of course, I didn't say the most horrible, deepest, darkest, ugly parts of my personality, so there are some things that I did leave out. For example, I tend to lash out easily when I'm over stressed and someone pushes my buttons. I'm super insecure, and tend to project my insecurities on my loved ones. These are truly the most horrible sides about me, and of course I would leave this out because it's not a sellable quality about myself. Honestly, if someone said they possessed these traits, I too would run away and not want to pursue a roommate agreement with them."

Being critical motivates me to a certain point, but once I complete something it never feels perfect and I'm always so focused on making everything perfect. As far as being impulsive, I would say I'm very emotion-driven so some of the decisions I make are based on how I feel in the moment. "

There are times when I find myself being the conversation starter and other occasions when I go with the flow. At first, I may seem a bit shy and reserved but usually, that's when I just observe and acknowledge the vibe of the situation or person so that I know what they like and don't like. Once I get comfortable and familiar with someone, I don't stop talking! I am an open-minded person who loves to try new things and experience different things; I don't mind going out of my comfort zone. Overall, I would like to say that I am a calm person. I rarely get offended because I don't take what other people say to me or about me too personally. On the other hand, when it comes to defending and caring for the people that I love, I can be quite protective.",

When it comes to my emotions, I keep them to myself because I feel like I may burden others with my issues when they might going through more stressful times. I am slowly learning that sharing my feelings with those I love and trust is imperative for my mental health but it's still a work in progress."

I like computers and I think I do well with them I play a lot of video games and I love learning new things through watching videos on youtube or just going to school. I do some sports but not a lot, I mainly surf and I like board games and strategy games, I really like any game in which I really need to think about a way to outsmart my opponents. I rarely get into something without trying to do it at a 100% whenever I get into a new video game that requires a skill I try to do my best to be competitive quickly. I love watching sports on tv from surfing to F1. But I also do not like to have to compete for something if I don't enjoy it. For example, I did not like doing community service and I always thought it was very fake whenever someone did community service and said they enjoyed it because the real reason they did it was that you want it to look good on their college application. I really dislike hypocrisy and I'd rather do what I think is right rather than what is best for me supposedly. If I don't enjoy something I don't do it unless it is absolutely necessary.",

I'm very flexible and wouldn't mind most lifestyle living, however I do have a set of rules I feel obligated to abide by in my room. In terms of how I present myself, I come off as very shy and kind, but to close friends and people I'm comfortable with, I would say I'm very funny and outgoing, always trying my best to support my loved ones. When comfortable, I love to talk, sometimes getting too ahead of myself, however, I also find sitting back and just people watching conversations to be fun as well. In terms of working, I am a borderline workaholic; if I'm not doing something productive or taking a power nap, I feel like I'm not contributing to anything. In terms of living, I'd identify with being an organized mess; things may not be sparkly clean and aesthetically organized, but it's nowhere near a pig stye. Having a fear of bugs, I make sure my room is clean an organized enough to avoid attracting pests. Adding onto my earlier point of being empathetic, I identify as being hardworking and having integrity for the benefit and responsibility of my community. On the negative side, I would say I am shy to strangers as well as socially anxious and a but awkward. Because of this, I tend to be scared of conflict and upsetting others. However, I value criticism and do want to help others grow, so I do push myself to be honest and always voice my intentions to be able so that they do not get the wrong idea. Overall, I would say my personality is that of true intention and genuine character. ",

I can be loud to sometimes when I am on the phone with friends or family, hope we can work together to find the balance of our boundaries.

I think this is one of reasons I love animals so much, especially dogs. I love being with dogs because they accompany you and stay by your side. Even if you do not talk to them, they stay with you because for them it is enough to be close to their human. Having said this, I also do enjoy being with some people. Like I said before, it is hard for me to be talkative and open up, but with some time, I do start to become more comfortable and to show a little bit more about my personality.

You do not say anything, you do not speak.\" Of course, it is important to mention that I have become even more quiet and less talkative in the past 1.5 years.

I would say overall, I am a pretty friendly and social person, and my humor lately has just been the trends on TikTok (haha, not very original). Before COVID, I felt like I was a social butterfly but after being home for over a year, I feel like I lost all my social skills. I am a picky eater, but I enjoy cooking from time to time. I respect other's personal spaces and privacy. Because I do not like confrontation, I tend to keep things to myself to avoid any conflict, but from time to time, I will muster up the courage and ask for something to be done if it really bothers me. I enjoy looking at nature, I find it calming and pretty except when bugs and insects came flying at me.. then I get scared and begin to freak out (fun fact: on the first day of school, I was stung by a wasp and panicked a lot). I also enjoy watching Kdramas, and have been getting back into Kpop (but I do not know if time will allow me to fully enjoy once school picks up).",

Imposter syndrome feels too real. I am already a sophomore (which feels unreal) and since it is my first time on campus, I feel lost and as though everyone has already made their friends. On the other hand, I enjoy picnics and just exploring around areas with my friends and having calm/relaxing days. I tend to laugh a lot, even when some things may not be funny..

Once I commit myself to something, I am fully 100% committed to it and will devote a lot of time and attention to it. However, there are times when I will temporarily drop that commitment just so that I can have some time to decompress after being fully focused on that task for a while. I tend to keep to myself and like to stay indoors instead of going out and socializing. There are times when I will appear very social and outgoing but majority of the time, I am not very social and crave time to myself. I enjoy reading and writing and have moments where I get really creative out of nowhere. Other than that, I tend to be an analytical thinker and tend to run more on logic than anything else. I can also be indecisive most of the time, which is a huge flaw that I am continuing to work on. I also am shy and will tend to keep to myself when in crowds so that I can take on a more observatory role in these environments. I am loyal to those who treat me with respect and will always try to return the respect ten fold. However, when someone wrongs me, I am very slow to forgive and may even hold grudges. ",

        "text": "I would say that I am a warm, curious, friendly, adventurous and open-minded person. I am warm in that I try to be as welcoming as I can be to new people I meet, and making them feel included in what I am doing. I am curious in that I love to learn new things and in particular am interested in people's stories, how they got to where they are and what makes them tick. Doing this brings me great joy. I am incredibly friendly to new people, as I am curious about them and want to make sure they feel included and cared about, so I find that that manifests in my efforts to be friendly to people. I am adventurous in I like to try new things, go to visit new places, eat new foods and meet new people. I am open-minded in that I don't hold firmly to my beliefs. I am open to different ways of being, speaking, and if someone has a perspective that challenges my own, I will view it as an opportunity to learn and change. In addition to these traits, I am very outgoing. I enjoy meeting new people in a variety of different contexts. I tend to have a few very close friends, but several friends in groups that span my interests. I find it especially important to do meaningful things with other people, I find that is how I typically make friends. Historically this has been through running, biking, singing, school work and language. This is typically when I have been happiest, wehen I have a variety of activities meaningful to me that I can do with other people. I care deeply about purpose. Doing things that are meaningful to me is very important. I get quite upset when I am engaged in work that is not meaningful. I find that the purposeless often leads me to the purposeful. Above all, my goal for my life is to lead a life of connection and purpose. These are the two most important things to me, close connections and meaningful work. I tend to seek out community wherever I am and not be very happy when I don't have a strong community. I tend to empathize and sympathize with people. I feel their pain oftentimes. Other people's stress does tend to affect me, especially if it is people I am close to. Other than that. I enjoy watching soccer, reading, listening to podcasts, mountain biking, cooking, watching birds and running around the track very quickly while drinking chocolate milk. ",

I have a tendency to crave certainty, and when I don't know what the outcome will be for a big decision I have made, I tend to get wrapped up in thinking and doubt whether I have made the right decision. This sometimes has negative effects on some of my interpersonal relationships. This can manifest in anxiety, a concern about how things will turn out. This can lead to catastrophizing, which often has no evidence to support it. I would also say that I struggle a decent amount with imposter syndrome. For a long time I have been concerned that people like me until they see the real me, and then suddenly they describe I am not worth their time. I find this comes from not being perfect. I am a perfectionist, and am afraid people will judge me for my imperfection, even though it is a natural part of being human. So sometimes I can get wrapped up in what people think, and am afraid of people not liking me. It can be very difficult for me when someone is upset at me, I tend to blame myself. This is also a consistent theme where I tend to consistently blame myself for everything, even when I was not at fault for a given situation. "

I also am an animal lover and will show you endless pictures of my dogs and my bearded dragon. I'm very intelligent and resourceful so if you have a problem, I probably know the solution already or can find it in no time. I'm creative in a few ways so I love to paint, sing, and dance. You'll always see me listening to music and unintentionally memorizing every single word of Lana Del Rey's various albums. I am understanding and flexible so communicate your needs and I will do my very best to meet them. I am a sensitive person so when I feel left out, ignored, or mistreated, even if it's a misunderstanding, I can get my feelings hurt. I am an open communicator though so if I sense something is off, I'll ask about it and move forward from there. I love doing things that give me a good dopamine rush like going to parties or clubs or even just adventures in the city. I have depression so some days I'm a bit off and you might feel some sad, negative energy. I'm a great listener and I love to hear about others' stories and how they got where they are. I have a special place in my heart for homeless people so when I see them, I offer food and water and I also offer to sit down and listen to what they have to say. Most of the time people avoid eye contact with them and it creates a disconnect between them and other people. They feel unseen. Sitting on the sidewalk, meeting them where they are at that moment, and just listening and brighten their days in ways you couldn't imagine. I like to end my moments with homeless people by offering a hug. They may smell, they may be dirty, but they're humans who crave love, attention, and physical affection just like you and I. I'm as kind as I can be and I consistently work on any negative attributes I may have.",

For example, if I think someone's outfit is ugly, I counter the thought with \"they could think yours is ugly, everyone has a different style\". Due to the medication I take, I can be irritable. Small things like changing plans, being late, or something not going as I expected can make me irritated and it takes me a little while to return to normal. I also mentioned my depression before, it makes me sad. When I'm sad, I'm mad that I'm sad so I can be more on the negative side then as well.

I have started journalling and coming up with actual ideas I want to write, and have created outlines. I just worry that the perfectionist in me will hold me back from ever actually writing those stories. As for hobbies, I like to bake, read, watch tv and movies, hang out with friends, hike or go on long walks, and I also weirdly like to clean. ",

When people do things like leave a mess in the kitchen, forget something on an assignment that seems obvious to me, or choose to ignore my advice about the cookies we are baking which end up coming out too gooey (too specific?), I get frustrated. I also sometimes think that while I have many insecurities, I think too highly of myself. I sometimes expect myself to be smarter than others, and other times think I'm too stupid to be in the same room as people. I don't think my arrogance is perceived by others, as my insecurity usually outweighs it. This is mostly insecurity about looks or achievements. I sometimes don't feel like I am as successful as those around me. I also have recently realized that I have a big jealously problem--when a friend comes to me with exciting news about how, for example, they got a job in the field I dream of working in one day, instead of being excited for my friend (which I am on the outside, but not on the inside), I get extremely jealous.  I am working on training my subconscious to not compare myself to others as much and understand that one person succeeding has nothing to do with me, and I should be happy for them, rather than jealous and bitter.

I am innately very extraverted, though I have no problem being alone and enjoy solo time to recharge, I flourish in social situations. There are some instances where I might shrink down, or feel insecure and introverted, but more often than not, I will out-\"social butterfly\" you. I enjoy speaking up in class and having deep or intellectual conversations as much as I enjoy quick quips and witty banter (I get that from my grandma), and love meeting new people. I am driven, academically, and have been raised to put my academic pursuits above most all else so when exam season rolls around, my neurotic/conscientious tendencies will be exhibited in incessant studying. Although it's always been a (big) part of who I am, since COVID my neuroticism has increased: I am much more anxious (especially about health and safety than I used to be) and am hyper-aware of my surroundings, making plans, and trying to 'control' my environment to protect myself and those I love. However, at the same time, I am very agreeable; I tend to shy away from confrontation, work hard to accomodate the wants/needs of others, and will often be permissive to a fault. I am working on being a better advocate for myself. So, although I do have my anxious side, I try not to project my nerves onto those around me and try to ensure they feel comfortable doing what they need to do for themselves as well. ",

I feel I gave them both equal time and spoke about them in honest/constructive ways without being dismal or hurtful in my description of my 'negative' traits. I can continue talking about my negative feelings/traits, though: I tend to fixate on possible negative outcomes when it comes to health/safety and, no matter how minimal the risk, try to control my behavior so as to avoid possible harm. If I am uncomfortable with the prospect of a situation I can spiral into nerves and worry and talk myself out of going but, more often than not end up going anyways and having a good time because I've been learning how to take care of myself in ways that I can control as opposed to trying to control external/environmental factors I cannot control. For example, I was really excited about going to an outdoor concert this summer, but as the show approached, I began thinjing of how many unmasked DeadHeads would be there in close proximety without my bveing able to know whether they were healthy, vaccinated, or tested recently. But, after consulting the venue's website and seeing their precautions and choosing to wear a more heavy-duty mask while at the concert, I decided to go anyways and had a great time. Is that too positive? I thought it showed a good story arc. Anywho, another thing is an inherited \"automatic no\" so maybe I didn't quite listen to this assignment. I also tend to appease othehrs and fall into my own agency traps making one-sided agreements that if I do x, y, and z for this person, they'll do/feel ___ for me, which can be damaging and goes hand in hand with what I talked about in the previous page about being nonconfrontational.

However, I also believe I have different personalities with different people, including my family members, close friends and surface level friends. With family, it is more difficult to describe my personality. I am less silly and more sarcastic and witty. Interestingly, with my family I act more mature and with close friends or surface level friends I am less mature. I am a very loyal friend whose main goal is to find more deeper connections than surface level interactions. I find this very important regarding my personality. I wouldn't define myself as a \"bubbly\" or optimistic/positive person. At times, I can be incredibly pessimistic and negative - which sometimes provides humor for others, and maybe that's why I am pessimistic. Additionally, I am very stubborn and despise being wrong. I find this to be embarrassing. Although I am pessimistic and negative at times, I view myself as a pretty friendly individual. I always want to find the good in a person - maybe not a situation pertaining to my own life. Also, I am a people pleaser - I dislike upsetting others or disappointing others.

This relates to my previous comment of me being \"reserved.\" I often put up walls that lead me to quickly judge others and boss people around. However, because I am a people pleaser, I often don't get my way - this establishes a cyclical relationship between my anxiety and people-pleaserism. "

This helps when living with others because you can talk to me about anything that my bother you or something that can better with change. I am an extrovert, which means I can be quite talkative and extremely energetic. I am eager to help others and kind-hearted when dealing with issues and treating others with respect, and being a loyal and reliable friend is the most important aspect of friendship to me. I am not the most creative person; I struggle with drawing and abstractness, but I love to write poetry. Even though poertry is quite abstract, it helps with anxiety and getting over mental humps that feel like large setbacks. I am hardworking and not lazy, which comes with being energetic and never wanting to just sit still. Speaking of energy, I am on the cal track team, and love to run. I carry the disciplines of sport into the classroom every day. I do not feel calm a lot and I feel my heart is always racing. That stems from the way I was born. ",

However, I hate living in a messy area as it disgusts me to look at it, so I usually don't let it remain messy for long and will clean everything up all in one go. \nI love to meet new people and see friends, and in fact tend to need someone with me at all times to feel motivated to do anything. For example, in previous living situations, if nobody else is home, I won't feel motivated enough to do things like homework, cook, etc. and will just watch tv or sleep. But I also enjoy my alone time and need space at nighttime when I am trying to just relax and wind down. \nI enjoy going out, doing activities and actual plans, but also being spontaneous in the moment. When there is nothing to do or I am bored with my friends, we will come up with something random to do in the moment - whether it be a walk, going to the city, thrift shopping, etc. Besides just doing random things as they come up, I enjoy activities that make me feel challenged or take me out of my comfort zone. One of the most spontaneous things I have done is skydiving and planning a Coachella trip under 24 hours. \nI think my personality is laid back and chill most the time, but also upbeat and energetic at times. I find myself going out of my way for others often and caring about my close family and friends and how they are feeling. However, I also tend to get moody sometimes and this shows when I take it out on people closest to me as well - parents, significant other, etc. \nOne of my love languages is quality time, whether it be with friends or a significant other, so I love when I can just be with the people I love - even if it isn't necessarily something fun or an actual plan that we're doing. Just being in the presence of others is something that makes me really happy and fulfilled. ",

However, for people who don't know me well or don't understand that sarcasm, they have often mistaken it for me being rude or mean, which is never my intention to be. \nSometimes I am really inflexible and not very understanding. I love for things to happen my way and when I want them to, and usually get irritated at others easily when I feel like something is going very different from what I had expected. I also don't tend to understand others situations and things that may arise when someone changes a plan on me, doesn't respond, etc. "

Mostly, I like one-on-one conversations and friendships. I'm not shocked by anything. I'm comfortable with dark thoughts and paradox. People like to tell me things about themselves. I worry a lot about other people and their problems. I'm spiritual and religious. I read a lot, and like Wittgenstein said of himself, I see everything from a religious point of view. I've been told I have an unassuming intelligence. I don't try to talk smart or say good things about myself. Oscar Wilde described a character once as being \"a wonderful gentleman, who never says a good thing and never does a bad one.\" I certainly do bad things, but I try to live up to that motto. Not as a matter of principle, but simply because I cannot conceive of authenticity and intimacy in any other way. I've described myself as a walking Dostoevsky character because of my ecstatic spiritual neuroticism. I also relate to Hamlet and Captain Ahab, since ideas have often ruled me in unhealthy ways. Ultimately, I'm just a lonely guy that wants hugs.",

I'm a more spiritual person now, but I'm still very flawed in how I form close relationship. Nonetheless, I'm incredibly grateful for my salvation and the patience that people have shown me during my spiritual journey.

I am very friendly and caring, and I prioritize my friends and family a lot in life. I am someone who places an emphasis on my social relationships, and I put a lot of effort into maintaining relationships with people I really care about. I have good integrity, and I am someone who has a strong moral compass. I want to surround myself with people who align with my values and morals because I am a big believer in surrounding yourself with people who make me a better person. I have a very chill personality, and I don't get very angry often. My biggest problem is that I avoid confrontations, so I tend to be very passive or hide my issues with people. That is something I have been wanting to improve about myself for many, many years. I tend to be very shy around new people, but I can get comfortable pretty easy if you make a good impression. I would say I have a dumb sense of humor, and I love to bond with people who can relate to that. As for my favorite activities, I really enjoy cooking. That is something I started to do this summer, and I have really grown to love it. I love watching crime documentaries and mystery movies as well as romance. I also love to hang out with my friends, especially when we go out to eat at restaurants. I would consider myself a huge foodie and love to explore different cuisines! My love language is serving food and eating food with people. If I could travel the world and eat everywhere, I would be living my dream come true! ",

As a result, I have a problem with communicating in my social relationships of things that bother me. Rather than directly confronting that person about any issues, I usually talk to someone else about it and let it pass. I would say I can also be selfish and prioritize what I want over what others may want. For example, I have two older sisters, and I sometimes place what I want to do as more important than what they want to do. Lastly, if and when I ever do get angry, I have a problem with controlling the spiteful things I say out of rage and anger. I would say mean things to intentionally hurt the other person's feelings, rather than try to calmly discuss and fix the situation. This often times happens with my boyfriend, and he gets deeply hurt over the things I lash out at him for. I can be very spiteful and petty when I get angry about something. "

I think a lot of that has to do with how I want to portray myself. I want to humanize myself and accentuate flaws, but also include that I am a work in progress, just like everyone else.

I am an overwhelmingly positive person, who tends to be joyful and revels in the beautiful things in life.

If I am joyful or in awe, I find that my experience of these feelings are validated when I share them with others.

I have a hard time identifying, expressing, and honoring what I want, which can lead to resentment in a variety of ways. \n\nI am a bad texter, and can make people around me feel less cared about because of my poor communication. I also sometimes take advantage of the idea of \"self care\" as an excuse to be lazy and unproductive. I measure much of my self-worth base on what other people think of me, which can manifest as deeply rooted insecurities as well as a constant need for validation. "

I'm a bit of a homebody, though I do like going out to walk in forests, near the beach, or to friend's houses for meals and board games. At home I tend to read, puzzle (jigsaw and crossword), and look up trivial facts. I also brew and drink coffee constantly, and I like to cook. I bake occasionally too. I don't really enjoy talking about myself, and I don't think I'm able to ignore spelling rules. I like to live in a tidy environment, but I'm not always great at doing the work to make it so. I'd like to clean a little bit regularly, but instead I tend to put it off and then have to treat the mess as a big project. I wonder if this exercise is just going to tally the words that look positive and the ones that look negative and then output the result as a big revealer of my mood or regularly expressed behavior. \n\n\n",

As far as roommates go, I clean after myself when cooking, I don't leave a mess anywhere, and I tend to go to bed and wake up on the earlier side. I can be quite emotional when it comes to shows and/or movies, but I have been able to get a handle and control them better lately. I'm pretty shy or reserved at first, but I'm a pretty good person and friend to have. Once we become closer and break out of the shell, I can be rather silly. Some of my friends would use funny to describe me as well, but I'm not a \"jokes\" type of funny, I'm more of just me \"Alex\" is funny. The things I say or how I behave is what is funny rather than try hard funny. ",

I often do my best to educate myself about what\u2019s happening around the world and find out if there\u2019s anything I can do. I care a lot about my friends and family, and I find myself going out of my way if they ever need help. I sometimes like to think of myself as a funny person (at least that\u2019s what my friends say!). I love making people smile or laugh, and I try my best to always be someone my friends and family can lean on. I think of myself as a very friendly and caring person, although I am not always approachable. I can also be very paranoid at times.",

However, if you show indifference, hatred, jealousy, greed, or any other negative emotion towards me, I will hold a grudge against you unless you apologize. I know that makes me sound a bit cold, but that is only if you do that to me. Otherwise, I am very bubbly, energetic, and smiley. When I am stressed with assignments -- particularly those that involve heavy reading, writing, and comprehension -- I may look a little bit sad. That is because when I am stressed, it shows clearly on my face. I am bad at hiding my true feelings and emotions, because my face or body language clearly shows it, according to my friends and family members. I also like to call my parents often, especially since I am living pretty far away from them because of school. I really love and miss my dog. I love working with children, which is why I am working at a child care center with preschoolers this semester, while also volunteering as a mentor at an elementary school in Oakland. Another thing about me is that I am very neat and organized. I like to clean up after myself, rather than leaving things out and making my space look messy. I enjoy doing the dishes to instill a peace of mind sometimes. I love gifting and receiving flowers from loved ones. I love hanging out with my friends and family. I enjoy watching Kdramas, only when I am fully free to do so. If I were to rank bread, rice, and noodles, I would rank it as noodles, rice, and bread. I love Pho; it is my all-time favorite food. I also really love Korean food, especially the soups and the meat/bbq. Going back to my personality (or rather my living style), I do neither snore nor walk in my sleep. I am scared of individuals who sleep walk. I love looking at pretty nature, ESPECIALLY beautiful sunsets. They are literal eye candy. My MBTI is currently ESFJ; it changes every time I take the test because I am almost 50/50 for each of the letters.",

I am the type of person to remember the bad things someone did to me (even if it was only once), and reciprocate their bad energy by also acting the same way they did to me. Another toxic trait of mine is that I tend to expect the worse. I think I can be both a pessimistic and an optimistic, but whenever a situation correlates to me, I always get pessimistic. If someone hypes me up, saying I definitely aced that exam or will get a certain achievement, I tell them no because they are going to jinx it. Of course, I thank them, but internally, I am a pretty strong Debby Downer. The last toxic trait of mine that I will mention is that I give silent treatment to those who \"wronged me,\" rather than being the bigger and more mature person by just confronting them. Confrontation is something that I am still learning how to do, or rather getting myself to do."

I also am awkward and shy, which is contradicting to my desires to form a lot of meaningful relationships with other people. This makes it difficult in group settings and going out at times."

I am very quiet and awkward and I have a hard time starting and maintaining conversations with people I have just met or are not extremely close to. I have social anxiety so I find it very difficult to speak to new people, or to speak in a large group of people. Because of this, I may come off as rude sometimes, but it is just that I don't know how to interact well, so I'd rather keep quiet and avoid interaction most of the time. However, if we get along well and have known each other for a long time, I will be more talkative and show my true personality. I am a friendly person, and I like to smile and laugh a lot. I am a nice person, but sometimes I will be too nice that I forget to stand up for myself. However, I know myself really well, so I know what I like and what I don't like. Whether it's about things or people, I know what I tolerate and what I don't. I am an extremely sensitive person. I really value honesty and communication between people. I have many favorite activities, which involve staying in or going out. But social interaction does wear me out, so I always need time to myself in a day.",

I guess that leaves me somewhere in the middle of those two. I'm not very worried if I have a loose plan or idea of how I will overcome a problem or how I will engage with any given day. I usually find myself talking to new people and making friends. I enjoy listening to other people tell stories and learning about new things. Nothing is better than a good story. For that reason I think I enjoy studying psychology, but also history and literature. Surprisingly, though, I am not much of a \"party person\".

I am looking to start off on the right foot. I think I can be neurotic and worry about others when I don't need to. I notice and stress about small things that others tend to not worry about. This can be both a good and bad thing. I am very bad at names, I often forget them as soon as I hear them and need to really focus on remembering them. I might judge people too harshly sometimes, but I am not sure. I often am not very good at learning skills much as playing instruments and learning language as others are. I am not sure why. It often takes me a while to process my feelings, and I can't react appropriately in the moment to an emotionally charged atmosphere.  "

Once I am comfortable with a group of people, it's easier for me to become more open about my feelings and thoughts, and the need to be alone decreases. However, when I am meeting a large group of people for the first time, I am usually quieter and less distant than those around me because it takes me a while to warm up. Regarding my feelings, I enjoy spending time with people I can create deeper connections with, which entails feeling comfortable with being vulnerable and opening up about topics that are not as surface. Since my top love language is quality time, I often enjoy doing activities that may seem like everyday things like getting groceries together, studying for classes, or just watching TV in each other's company. Of course being intentional about having good conversations and doing exciting things are important, but I value company over everything.  ",

It takes me a while to get comfortable with people so I would say to be patient with me as my inner personality seeps out. I would tell them that once I am comfortable I tend to be a fun and spontaneous individual who likes to try new things so long as I am with people that I trust. My favorite activities include reading and watching tv shows//documentaries/ movies. Therefore there will be times when I need my personal space from others. I would think of myself as an introvert so I would make sure express that to my roommate just so they don't feel like I'm ignoring them or anything. But I also like to go out here and then. I am also a very good listener though it is hard for me to talk back or express my own emotions. So if I'm quiet it doesn't mean I don't care, it just means I'm processing it all and trying my best to find the best way to respond. When cooking I like to do it alone because people watching me tends to make me nervous as I am insecure of my cooking style (not the best). But overall, I am a nice person whether I'm comfortable or not and will never try to make things dramatic or anything. I like peace and that is what I strive to achieve in my life since it can be chaotic at times. I like to be organized but it is hard for me to keep up when it comes to my own space. I like to hoard a lot of stuff, sadly. Memories can never be forgotten. ",

I definitely appreciate and enjoy the little things in life, from the pretty nature and sunsets, good food, the sound a bird chirping, and more.

I am also someone who is almost incapable of hating another individual. I frequently give others the benefit of the doubt and forgive and forget rather than holding a grudge and keeping my distance.

I also love being independent in college after growing up with relatively strict parents, but I love being independent only if I am around loved ones and friends and family.

I am slow to anger, but once I am, you better be out of my line of sight and vicinity. I won't lash out at you, but I bottle up my emotions and will speak in a sour tone. If I am stressed or angry, every noise or action someone does will annoy me greatly. Do not comfort me, for I will then actually lash out on you if you continue to overstep boundaries. I am a planner, not spontaneous. I am rigid and believes everyone and thing should be and act a certain way. I have high expectations for others and they almost always fall short of them. I am too ambitious for my own good, leaving me to pursue too many things until I am spread thin and burn out. I commit to things very easily, and once I start something, I will takes many hours perfecting it until it is truly finished. I am a perfectionist, but combined with my learning difficulties/disabilities, everything takes me much, much longer to complete than the average person. "

I love the study of people. Whether that be through history, hard sciences, the psychology behind human action, emotion, or art, it is all so interesting to me. I feel like as a kid, I always felt like a bit of an outsider, and I was looking at other people as a researcher looking through glass, and I was trying to understand these subjects that I felt so different from. It still is something that I haven't cracked and that I constantly want to know more about. Math, physics, chemistry, and the other STEM disciplines are really interesting to me, but I never could wrap my head around them. I love my family and I am very close to my friends.

I would describe myself as a daydreamer who often fantasizes about unrealistic goals that I want to achieve. Even though I may not express my emotions outwardly as often as the average person, I express them through creative outlets, such as writing. When I experience negative emotions, I tend to bottle it up inside until I can no longer hold them in. I dislike showing my weak side to anyone, especially to people that I am close with. I feel that I am also lacking in self-confidence and often find myself comparing my looks to others. I also hate confrontation and try to avoid conflicts whenever possible. I am known for being a little stubborn when it comes to changing my opinion about certain issues that I feel strongly about.",

I can be a bit rigid in my cleanliness -- I really appreciate waking up to a clean apartment and an empty sink, but also understand that it isn't always possible. I do like going out and meeting new people but I can be rather shy at first/ am much more sociable with a beer first. I like to have quiet mornings and am always looking forward to my cup of coffee. I also like to paint but tend to be really good about keeping my art supplies in my room/ not in the common areas. I think of myself as a good listener and would always love to have day debriefs/ rants. I can sometimes need my space though but am pretty good at making that known. If I am in a bad mood, i'll tell you, but this isn't a super frequent thing. I tend to be very happy-go-lucky, goofball energy and am always down for a good laugh. ",

This has resulted in me leaving doors unlocked, taking the tv remote to strange places, and leaving every cabinet in the house open. If I am really tired, I can be short and grumpy, not having much of a bandwidth for other people. I am good at recognizing this though and will give you a heads up. Also, a weird one, but I hate hearing someone watching videos on their phone (i.e. tik tok and youtubers). My sister used to do it when I was younger and I don't really like/ appreciate the content on there so I find it super annoying to listen to second hand. I will sometimes sing which can be annoying because I stink. Never a whole song or for hours I'll just randomly transition half way through my sentence into some sort of melody. Also, when it comes to the cleanliness, I can be a little anal, mainly in the kitchen. It really grosses me out when there is food debri on the counters/ in the sink. Oh! and I cannot with a wet sponge in the sink. Ew ew ew I have to wring the water out after the dishes and leave it to the side. "

I am strong-willed and a great speaker, communicative in public settings and in writing things down in creative forms. I want to use my education to advance sustainable efforts and I believe we all have a responsibility to make the world a better place. I experience emotions very deeply. I take things very personally and tend to analyze situations a lot. I mean what I say. I value authenticity. I can argue my point but I can also accept when I was wrong, sometimes begrudgingly. I don't feel the need to have a lot of friends - quality over quantity. I like to have fun. I like to dance and laugh and tell stories. I like being the center of attention and the leader of groups. I like to be intellectually stimulated in conversation and in books. I sometimes neglect my physical well being for the responsibilities I have placed on myself. I tend to stretch myself thin. I tend to look down on my physical appearance and mental abilities and claim that as realism. I value deep connections with people. I fear for the future of our world but most of the time I do not actively worry. I'm a doer. I tend to have visions and delegate. I often believe I have the right way of doing things. I'm a romantic. I get tired very easily. I am finding it a bit hard to talk about myself for ten minutes. I value staying connected to world news but also know it can lead to undue mental stress. I like to learn but not about everything just the things that interest me. I thrive best in orderly and clean environments, but I often go through some messy periods. I try to express my gratitude in words, or my feelings in general. I can get embarrassed by this though.",

Once I start to open up I became quite loud and a little odd my humor is not conventional. In relationships I am loyal, if I have deemed you worthy of calling you a friend just know that it means that I will do pretty much anything for you. I have anxiety and sometimes it comes through a little more so when I do get anxious or feel a panic attack coming on then I tend to close off and try and deal with it on my own so as not to alarm anyone. I love in uncoventional ways as well and my love language is quality time so I try to make an effort to get one on one time in different relationships. I am family-orientated and that is not limited by blood, most of my friendships are 10 years or older and those people I deem family because they have seen me at my worst. I sit in the middle of being introverted and extroverted, while I do enjoy going out and having adventures I also can spend a friday night at home doing nothing but watching movies and I love it just as much. Often times if I have been social for days at a time I will need a day just to myself to recharge because I do get overwhelmed  quite easily. Repetitive noises or obnoxious people tire me and often in arguments I tend to cry out of frustration. ",

But I feel that this this may come across as if I am boring and not animated - which I could be sometimes. I really love to play guitar and sing, and recently I got into gaming and playing fortnite and valorant. I used to play volleyball in high school and I kind of miss being fit and athletic. I hope that I dont lose all my willpower to be somewhat fit over the school year. I think that I am also an ambivert, where I love to be both around people and by myself equally. I can be alone for days and be happy, and I can also hang out with people for days and be just as energized. I do not like meeting new people though. I love to make more friends but also I find it super tiring and alot of work, I wish that I can skip the acquaintance part of things with people and go straight to friends. I am also very much a helper in which I really love to help people and want to do that as my career. As a psych major, I want to help those with mental health issues and support people who have been through trauma or deal with such mental barriers that cannot be fixed by medicine or some type of physical form of care. I think I want to dedicate my life to helping those in need. I also like novelty and change alot. For example, I don't actually think I'd want a tattoo or even drinking, but I would want to try and get drunk and maybe get a tattoo for the thrill. I like seeking out new adventures and exploring with friends. It makes life more exciting.",

This is also probably where my self-diagnosed OCD comes from, like being organized and things being as planned otherwise I do get a bit irritated. I am at times irritable when things do not go my way or people are not listening to me, which is also why sometimes I tend to close myself off when I feel like my opinions won't matter or I. think someone will reject me or my ideas. I would like to say that I am a happy person and like to enjoy life one day at a time, take adventures, and hang out with friends. I am also a family person, love my siblings and. being the oldest makes me feel like a second mom to them. and always wanting to take care of them and give them whatever they need and set a great example for them. I am athletic, I currently play basketball but also have some background in football, track, and cross country. Always loved playing sports and was down to try anything that was given to me.

If certain friends who I am individually close to are getting closer to each other than they are to me, then it will oftentimes cause me to question why this is happening. This can manifest into jealous feelings as well. Additionally, because I am more of an emotional person, this can cause me to be very loving and passionate in my friendships, but can also cause me to be clingy or mean at times when I do not feel appreciated in my friendships. This is something that I would have to work on. Something that I also try to work on more is being able to better express my negative emotions, as I often bottle this up and sometimes it gets let out all at once. "

I always want to make sure that other people feel heard and that they can could come to me if there are any issues/concerns, or if they need someone to talk to. I also like to make sure people feel included and that they feel welcomed to join friend group activities. ",

My anxiety can sometimes get in the way of other things happening in my life whether that be my academics or socially. For example, if I am stressed about school or for a particular exam, I tend to isolate myself from other people and only focus on my academics. I also don't participate in the activities that I usually enjoy doing such as painting and drawing, and I don't go outdoors as often. When I am anxious, my room also tends to be more disorganized. "

I was a very shy person in the past but got open-minded and friendly after having hands-on retail management experience at my dad's business. I personally thought going to school was never going to work for me but slowly realized that I was worth more than just being a manager. We all deserve more in life and should not settle for less. You will really like my jokes (no guarantees haha). As a general personality trait, I would say I grew up in India and so have been in a lot of poverty-type environments. Then I came to the US about 10-12 years ago. Since then I have tried changing and being as Americanized as I can be but still have mostly been the person that I was in India. I really admire someone working hard no matter what field it is, what type of job it is. I have been in people who dont like to work and just want easy money and since then I have realized Fortune Favors the Brave!.  So we will get along well as long as we both give in our best in giving free time to the cleaning of this place and share out thoughts about different things. ",

I'm a very playful person but it's all intentional and I'm not actually as shallow as I act.

Or if someone passes me the salt and they later ask me to pass them a napkin I'll be annoyed. Sometimes I overthink brief interactions and create an idea of someone in my head without forgiveness when in actuality the person isn't like that. I have trouble expressing gratitude or positive feelings for family and friends. Even though it's very important to tell people you love them, I internally cringe and freak out when I'm prompted to do so and instead react with making fun of people. I don't hold onto people for my whole life and believe that people are only in my life for brief stages until the next come. "

Im not shy 1 on 1, but if I were in a larger group setting of people I didn't know you might need to introduce me to them. Im funny, but very sarcastic. Once I get comfortable with you there will be some making fun of you, but in a goofy and non mean way. I love my space clean. Who doesn't like a clean and fresh house! I am always down for a little adventure, but I'm probably not as spontaneous as you'd think. Because I do love just hanging around on the couch! I am very sweet and honest. Okay maybe not sweet, but I am nice. I will compliment you but I will also tell you when your outfit looks ridiculous! I feel like I cry a lot, but usually only when it comes to movies. I play softball, and played more sports when I was younger. So, I love to stay active. Maybe we could get a membership together! On Sundays I like to get reorganized, whether that means cleaning the bathrooms, redecorating some part of the house, and just lighting a candle and binge on movies. I love pets, but I also won't be mad if you don't want any. They are dirty and can get stinky. One more thing that I think is worth mentioning. I don't usually study or binge on homework, so if you see me doing homework in the living room or kitchen table ... I am definitely okay with small talk, but give me 30 minutes and my full attention will be on you! I cannot study in my room, Im too comfortable there! Well, this is me and I hope we workout together as roommate :)",

        "text": "I am someone who enjoys learning. I like to try new things. I like to cook to decompress; learning new recipes is always a fun pass time. I also enjoy one-on-one time with close friends; we can talk for hours! I don't like to deal with stubborn people, although I have learned how to manage that; I basically just let them learn from their own mistakes (it is just not worth arguing). I think that emotional intelligence is really important, and something that I am always trying to build up within myself. I like to watch shows of all types of genres, except for horror ones. I like the outdoors, being surrounded by nature helps me stress relieve. I also find relief in journaling; I like to spend time reflecting on my thoughts and emotions, and just word-vomiting on paper. I also like to make my friends/family laugh! I will make friends with people who are open-minded, understanding, respectful, accountable, honest, and intelligent! I am someone who values independence. I also like to stay active; sports are always fun! I like a challenge; friendly competition :) I like to understand other people; whether it is through people watching or just talking to an individual to get to know them better. I love the beach. I like to go on hikes. I am a fan of watching soccer. I like watching cooking videos on youtube. I am someone who likes to problem solve. I think that it is important to be kind to yourself and others. I am someone who works hard. I am someone who is caring and responsible. I like to do things on time. I am someone who does not like laziness. I do not appreciate arrogance. I would like to be more confident in myself. I am very courteous of other's personal space. I am approachable...although if you get on my bad side, chances are slim haha~!",

I can also have an ego about certain aspects of my life. I may not be as humble. Sometimes I may make others feel excluded. I am trying to work on these parts of my personality.

I consider myself an introvert, which means that I may not immediately feel comfortable opening up to strangers. However, I am still very open to new people and experiences and enjoy variety in my life. I don't have many friends, but I have very close friends with whom I spend a lot of time with and confide in. Most outsiders would consider me \"shy\" and studious, but my friends are more likely to describe me as ambitious, confident, or caring.\n\nIn terms of my values, as a college student, academics definitely play a central role in my life. I consider myself academically-oriented and concientious--I always put in my full effort in all my work and stay very organized with all my activities. I approach the rest of life with a similar attitude as my academics; I prefer to plan and stay in my comfort zone the majority of the time.\n\nOn the spectrum from type-A to type-B, I definitely lean more towards the type-A side: as mentioned above, I am a constant planner, and I feel more comfortable when I know what is coming. I can get stressed easily when unexpected events occur.\n\nDespite this, I am also generally a very positive person. On most days, I would say my mood (on a scale of 1-10), hovers around a 6-7. Even if something upsets me, I can usually recover very quickly and paint negative events in a more positive or realistic light. When coping with troubles, I tend to take a practical approach where I come up with concrete steps to address a problem and act on them. ",

I find it hard to reach out to new people and make new friends.

I tend to get easily upset and irritated when things aren't clean and orderly in the home. I am respectful of other people and their space/belongings in the home. I tend to be a depressed and sad emotional and mental state which results in me often staying in my room a lot. It's easy for me to talk to my roommates, but hard to get close as I tend to isolate myself from others including the people I already know. My favorite activities are playing video games and doom scrolling which are certainly detrimental to my mental health and attribute to my destructive coping mechanism of isolation. You could say I'm also a bit self-sabotaging in that way. However, I take great care in not imposing my issues with mental health onto my roommates. It is easy for me to talk openly about these issues when they come up naturally, but I still make sure to maintain a clean space in the home by leaving all the trash in my own room when it gets rough. Roommates who have previously witnessed my depressive states in the past have been kind enough to try and help me by inviting me to go out or encouraging me to get a pet. However, I'm rather stubborn and independent. While the efforts are appreciated, I stick to my ways of isolation. It is incredibly difficult for me to ask for help, so I am always grateful when the people in my life see that I need it and offer it willingly. Mental health issues aside, I love going out to new restaurants and doing new things around the city. I do enjoy spending time with my roommate, but also greatly value my alone time.",

To expand on what I previously shared about being inclined to be depressed and isolating myself, this can manifest in not seeing me for days, weeks, or even months (at its worst). It is also difficult for me to face conflicts, so I tend to keep issues to myself and let them boil up. This has sometimes resulted in me exploding in anger and frustration at the people in my life. This hasn't come up as much in a roommate scenario. Instead, when things are going wrong in a living situation I will take it upon myself to just find a new place to move into. I'm very much a homebody who keeps to myself, which may not align with most people (especially other college students). Whenever I'm asked how I'm doing and when I choose to be honest, I usually don't find many positive things to share. This can make me a bit of a negative person to be around as it seems I'm always struggling with depression or something mental health related."

When I get stressed out about something, I struggle to handle it in the best way, sometimes being rude, or curt with the person I am interacting with. When I get a bad grade in school, I also tend to not handle that in the best way, becoming very irritable. "

I am very spontaneous, always down for anything, and love to stay busy. I place a high importance on my social life and relationships with others. Although I am spontaneous, there are certain things that I will not take risks on, and can get anxious when faced with certain social situations. I am a major procrastinator and usually need to be out of the house to get work done. I work better under pressure. I am pretty messy when on my own, but am also a people pleaser so will make sure to keep the room clean so that I don't bother you. I am an ENFP on the Myers-Briggs test. I am pretty sensitive to criticism from others. Some of my favorite activities are dance, musical theatre, traveling, figure skating, and gymnastics. ",

I often get nervous in some social situations, and am not the social butterfly I would like to be.

I would also describe myself as a person who is an extrovert and enjoys meeting new people and engaging in important conversations that expand my knowledge. In the scenario where I would be faced with meeting a new individual and becoming roommates with them, I would make sure to get to know them to my best ability. The reason for this is because I am looking for ways to learn more about topics that I lack knowledge on, such as their culture and what they enjoy doing, what makes them happy, and what they are interested in. When I do this, I get to build a strong connection with that certain individual which makes us feel more comfortable to share deeper conversations and expand both of our minds. On the topic of deep conversations, my personality is one that enjoys conversating about ideologies that speak volumes. I enjoy creating conversations about the ocean, outer space, time, the human brain, and more interesting topics. I am also a person who holds the characteristics of an extrovert. I love to meet new people and I can easily engage in a conversation with them about absolutely anything. I also like to think of myself as a very fun and outgoing individual who is pretty adventurous but also very responsible at the same time. I would describe myself as an athletic person since I play water polo and I enjoy swimming. Speaking of, in my dorm room I brought a rescue tube from my job as a lifeguard back home with me. My roommates were confused about what it was, and explaining to them the procedures of a lifeguard and a first responder was very rewarding, I was able to inform them about the lifeguarding community and teach them a few things which I really enjoyed doing so. I love to inform others and teach them new things, and I love when they do the same in return. ",

They are not necessarily bad people, since every individual has a few negative traits which make us who we are. A few negative traits that I had left out in my previous response is that I am a very heavy overthinker. I tend to overthink the smallest things which cause me to ruin my entire day just by thinking about something small or having no importance at all. This is a negative characteristic I have because when I am overthinking something, my entire mood and attitude begin to change since it is the only thought I am having in my brain. It is very hard to overcome this sort of negative behavior, but it also allows me to understand that it is a human emotion that I can deal with and it allows me to be conscious about what is going on and why I am overthinking a certain topic. Instead of feeling bad about myself for it, I like to take it as a learning experience and I allow myself to grow and understand the situation from a better and different perspective. I like to talk it out with a close friend and explain my emotions to them, get their feedback, and reflect if the situation is truly concerning to the point where I have to continue stressing or thinking about it for multiple hours or days.

Although I like spending time with other people, I am relatively selective of who I surround myself with. I am very particular about the people I spend time with, but in turn I feel that I have quite strong relationships with those people. That being said, I also enjoy my free time and personal space to recharge my social battery. In terms of interests, I am on the rowing team here at school and have been rowing since the start of high school. It is a big passion of mine and I spend a lot of time dedicated to the sport and my teammates. When I'm not rowing, I like spending time with friends, hanging out with my girlfriend, and seeing my family. I love going out to eat, but it's not super often that I try new places. I am a consistent person who knows what they like, and don't typically deviate from it.\n",

I think this is a habit that started as a little kid to appear cool and nonchalant. Now it's a subconscious thing, but I think it achieves the purpose that I started it for. Another potential negative characteristic about me is that I can be a little extreme in regards to the things I do or do not care about. I have found that if I don't actually care about something, I put little to no effort into it and that can be interpreted as lazy or not disciplined."

My ego is the one that mirrors, but even when I mirror others here are a few traits of my personality (that stay consistent), I am quirky I will do things in very odd ways, I ramble ALOT, I am very sarcastic, and I am a very empathetic person(so I have been told) in the sense that I am an active listener. Which my empathetic trait leads me to be compassionate, kind, kind of a push-over, and overall self-less in the sense I will put others needs before my own. ",

        "text": "I would say that I'm a relatively complex person, in that I fit into a wide variety of stereotypes and belong to none in particular. \n\nOn one hand, I identify as an extrovert -- this past summer, the majority of my time I spent hanging out with friends and exploring SF, nearly spending entire days surrounded by other people. I also would say that my loneliest times at Cal are when I've been at home while no one else is -- I hate the feeling of FOMO, and more than that, I think the majority of the joy I gain from daily life is talking to others. This summer, I specifically made the trip into my office (~25 min walk) just so that I could see others and enjoy spontaneous points of interaction, be that at the Cafe, at my desk, or somewhere in between. I love planning trips with friends and also love to go on spontaneous adventures as well.\n\nOn the other hand, I can definitely be very introverted/antisocial at times. Most of my fall 2020 semester I spent alone, with just my mom for company as we waited out quarantine in our Santa Cruz residence. I had a great time embracing solitude and finding joy in the little moments, like finishing a good hike or taking a quick jog in the morning. I also love cafes and libraries, and most of my hobbies are individual tasks (reading, painting, drawing, walks, etc.). I would say that I am a very reflective person, and I spend a good deal of my time alone thinking about my values and goals, and meditating on them. \n\nI would say in terms of my feelings, that I feel deeply. If I'm happy, I've been known to be the center of the party -- I love to pull people into my happiness bubble, and to share the joy that I'm feeling with my friends, family, and even strangers. If I'm sad, I feel sad deeply as well -- I cry at least 1-2 times a semester because of difficulties that I'm facing, and I also see embracing sorrow as a healthy way of recalibrating my emotions. Given that, I think that my feelings can be relatively volatile at times, especially since I think that I vary between strong moods (ex. being really sad/happy for a while) or intense emotions that pass surprisingly quickly (ex. I was really sad on Saturday that the summer was over, but now, a few days later, I feel as if that was a long time ago and a very different person at that).",

For example, I've made it no secret that I made a really close group of friends this summer, and I think that sometimes when I talk to my Berkeley friends they feel as if I've already moved on as a person. \n\nFinally, I think that try as I would like, I still get jealous easily and wish that parts of my life were different. It makes me sad/envious that most of my good friends are now in relationships, and at times I wonder why I couldn't be like them too. I also feel jealous when it comes to the number of friends people have, or how spread out they are (most of my friends are in CA), or other social aspects like that."

I love spending time both by myself and with others, though I often need time to recharge after having spent time with others for a long period of time.

I'm curious about the world and love to have deep conversations exploring profound topics and even debate about them, seeking to understand the other person's perspective and how they got to believe what they believe. I'm ambitious in terms of career goals, hopeful in terms of how things will turn out, and often use my faith in God as both motivation to keep going and hope that everything will turn out okay in the end. I love exploring new places, going on walks, and trying to become the best version of myself that I can be in every way. Lastly, in terms of how I'd be as a roommate, I'm a fairly organized individual who keeps and leaves things clean, tidy, and organized! I don't focus well at all in spaces that feel cluttered.

I wish I could be more upfront with people and tell them when they did something that bothered me instead of bottling it up until I end up resenting them. I have a habit of giving silent treatment when Im upset as if ther should know what they did wrong. I have a hard time getting close with someone in fear they decide they don't like me because that level of rejection cuts deep. I feel like people would describe me as awkard but funny in a group setting. I can't make much small talk but I can contribute to a conversation already happening. I wish I had an easier time liking myself and just opening up to people but it is very hard. In another life I would be more confident in the person I am but in this one I am very unsure."

I tend to be an anxious person but for people who don't know me very well this isn't obvious, as people also tend to describe me as outwardly calm. I consider myself to tend towards the shyer side when I first meet people but this seems to be less the case the older I get. I can be both talkative and reserved depending on context and how well I know a person. I am very self-aware of how I appear to others meaning I don't easily reveal personal details about myself. Around people I am comfortable with, I am very silly and love to joke around. Sometimes I can be easily annoyed but I also tend to keep my judgments to myself unless I am very comfortable with a person. I also have been told that I am energetic; however, I also have times when I'm feeling tired or reserved and in those moments I am not as bubbly or vivacious. I consider myself an introvert and very much value my time alone; when I've been in a big group for too long, especially one where I feel I have to exert a lot of social energy, I find myself getting overstimulated and tend to retreat inward. That being said, I really appreciate time with others, especially one-on-one or smaller group interactions with close friends and family who I feel like I can be myself around and notice myself feeling sad when I've been by myself for too long. I consider myself very caring in general but I also have my moments where I can be selfish. I value my morals and always strive to be a good person and value service towards others. I am very self-aware and introspective. I am ambitious by nature and that means I'm constantly motivated to improve myself; that also means I can be self-critical at times. I am a fairly self-disciplined person and consider myself very organized and on top of things. ",

However, I left out the fact that I can be very indecisive sometimes and find myself asking others for opinions on what I should do. I am not very direct in my communication unless I'm very comfortable with a person, and find myself keeping complaints to myself even if they're bothering me a lot. I find confrontation very difficult in certain cases. I can be a bit uptight sometimes and worry too much about small things, such as spending money even when it's not a big deal. I can take things personally easily and I'm not good at receiving criticism. In general, even though when I reflect I feel pretty happy with who I am, I wouldn't say I am the most confident person but this is not necessarily super apparent externally--hence my indecisiveness and inability to be very open with people I am not super comfortable with. I overthink a lot of my interactions and spend a lot of time planning for the future instead of being present."

I also can sometimes goof around or if I am with close friends I talk a lot so I feel bad for doing those things. Although Im organized with time, when it comes to actually executing my plans I will often back out a little bit before they can be executed in which the plans become cancel or I decide to then just go along with the plan either way.

I am typically introverted in social settings, but once I warm up to the crowd I know how to make people laugh. I am a very loving person and that love involves everything from nature, to people, to animals. I'v been inquisitive since I was a child and to this day I often question things I don't know. At least once a day I get an interesting question in my head and I have to look it up immediately. I am a small library of random facts. Although I am typically timid, I am not afraid to speak in public. I know my presence commands attention, as a kid and teen that would intimidate me but I've grown into it. I provide emotional support and encouragement to the people in my life. I am one of the first that people come to when they need advice or just a listening ear. As for myself, I am always evolving but keep compassion and empathy at my core. I am honest with myself and with others. Integrity is extremely important to me and I always own up to my mistakes.",

I am a very emotional person who feels things deeply, but over the years I have learned to feel, take the lesson, and move on without reacting. Before it was very easy to react immediately to a set-back, but after years of working at it I can say I process my feelings the best way for me. If I had to pick a negative characteristic, I'd say my bluntness isn't always well received. I have to watch the way I phrase things sometimes because I am very straightforward and jump into honestly to fix things. That doesn't always go to well with others."

I'm pretty happy go lucky and am definitely happy to chat for long periods of time depending on who I'm with. I just tend to need more time to recharge on my own, and I don't think I tend to be much of a bother in shared living spaces- I'm happy to hang out but just as happy to chill alone. I'm very organized and neat, and keeping both my life & my living space kept up like this really reduces my stress levels! If my future roommate would be able to do something similar and keep things clean I'd really appreciate it. As for activities, I like creative things like art and writing, as well as playing video games, and I always love watching movies or new shows, especially if I have someone to do it with! While I'm quite the homebody I also love to go out and see parks & try new restaurants and things along those lines. I'm also pretty good at listening and giving advice/emotional support if that's ever something you need! ",

I'm also very bad at holding grudges and tend to be in the mindset of \"if I forgive I won't forget\". I also tend to take things personally that might not be meant that way, and while I generally am quite chill about most things that people say/do I read a lot more into tone/body language than might be ideal and have a tendency to respond accordingly.

I am fairly anxious and stressed out generally speaking. I like for things to be organized and I hate feeling out of control. I also have A.D.D, which makes it difficult for me to focus. I am very outspoken and passionate about what I believe in. I think I have a good sense of humor and I enjoy laughing as well as making other people laugh. I consider myself friendly, but I can also be somewhat quick to judge. It takes me a while to feel comfortable with people and I am sometimes awkward when I feel like I do not know someone well enough. I am very ambitious and often take on more than I can handle at one time. I am most certainly an over-thinker, and I need someone to sometimes talk me down when I am overthinking and spiraling. I love food and cooking. I would also consider myself a creative person, I do photography and I am creative when I am cooking in the kitchen. I am often really sleepy and tired but I am kind of both a night owl and an early bird, which doesn't often help in making me less tired. I like being adventurous, but I also like being a couch potato and curling up on the couch. I love animals and always like to have a pet to cuddle with and hang out with. I would say that my love language is gifts. I love both giving gifts and getting them. I am also a huge planner and lister. I enjoy making elaborate plans for the people in my life and celebrating the little things. I also love making lists for absolutely everything because my A.D.D makes me forget things super easily, so making lists helps me. ",

I really can hate rich people, mostly out of envy because their wealth is so outrageous. I am easily disgusted by anyone in sorority or frat culture - 100% also out of envy and the want to fit in.

I think I'm very expressive, in relation to saying what is on my mind, but of course not about rude things. I also point out things that bother me, that's a part of being expressive. I especially do this more with people i'm more comfortable with. I am also very confident in myself and sometimes talk about myself in a good light. On the flip side, I do not talk about what i don't find confident in myself or about what I do that bothers myself. So things that bother me about myself is not talked about, but sometimes I feel over critical of others because of my outspokenness."

However, when I switch to English, I become more quiet and reserved especially with a larger group. I like to have deep conversations with a few people instead of small talks with a big group of people. I am emotionally stable when I am around people that I don't know very well. I become more emotional and easy to frustrate when I am with my closest ones. I am not a neurotic person, meaning that I don't often fall into a tunnel vision or get anxious over it. I am low-key competitive but would not do anything to hurt others because of that. I am kind and believe that I should do no harm to others. I am easygoing and informal, and I hate formal events that need unnecessary small talks and big openings. I am temperamental, and I would not pretend to like a person if I don't. I am impatient sometimes, so I do everything really fast. However, I do procrastinate to the last moment, but I tend to get most of my tasks done last minute. I am a very conflicted person too because a lot of my believes contradict themselves. ",

I am an insecure person, so I value a lot on how my friends perceive me in a conversation, and I would second-guess myself the second I feel something different with my friends.

I can be a little cocky, which is a personal flaw. I would say that I am confident. Definitely more extroverted than introverted. I can be a couch potato sometimes because I have been lazy recently. I don't like to make plans and often do things on impulse. I have a terrible spending habit. I have commitment issues so it's hard for me to be in romantic relationships and I am super loyal to my friends. I love gossiping so please spill the tea. I'm 5'4\", slim to average build. I like to joke around a lot. I laugh at everything (especially my own jokes) and I think I'm funny. I have a mean resting face, but I swear I'm not mean and I can be fun to hang out with. ",

For example, I got extremely used to life at home during the pandemic.
